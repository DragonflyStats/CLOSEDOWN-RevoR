t seconds after a ball is thrown vertically from ground, at a velocity of 30 meters per second, its height h changes with time as follows: 
h(t) = - 5 t2 + 30 t 
where h is in meters. 
For how long will the height of the ball be more than 25 meters? 



t seconds after a ball is thrown vertically from ground, at an velocity 30 meters per second, its height h changes with time as follows: 
h (t) = - 5 t2 + 30 t 
where h is in meters. 
What is the the change in the height of the ball between t = 1 and t = 2 seconds?
