\subsection*{Estimating Correlation and Variance/Covariance Matrices}

The \texttt{rxCovCor} function in RevoScaleR calculates the covariance, correlation, or sum of
squares/cross-product matrix for a set of variables in an .xdf file or data frame. The size of these
matrices is determined by the number of variables rather than the number of observations, so
typically the results can easily fit into memory in \texttt{R}. A broad category of analyses can be
computed from some form of a cross-product matrix, for example, factor analysis and principal
components.

A cross-product matrix is a matrix of the form X'X, where X represents an arbitrary set of raw or
standardized variables. More generally, this is a matrix of the form X'WX, where W is a diagonal
weighting matrix.

\subsection*{12.1 Computing Cross-Product Matrices}
While rxCovCor is the primary tool for computing covariance, correlation, and other crossproduct
matrices, you will seldom call it directly. Instead, it is usually simpler to use one of the
following convenience functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item rxCov: Use rxCov to return the covariance matrix
\item rxCor: Use rxCor to return the correlation matrix
\end{itemize}
