Higher Certificate, Paper II, 2001. Question 1
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item If random samples are taken from a non-Normal population, whose mean and
standard deviation are known to be $\mu$ and $\sigma$ , then when the sample size n is large the
sample mean ( X , say) will be approximately Normal with mean $\mu$  and standard
deviation
n
$\sigma$ . The approximation improves as n increases, and is adequate for
moderate size n if the X distribution is not very skew. The total of n observations has
a similar distribution (scaled up by a factor n). Thus estimators that are averages or
totals can often be taken as approximately Normal.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let N, S be the new and standard sprays respectively; then the mean XN − XS
can be taken as N(249 − 237, 490 410
100 100
+ ) approximately (inserting the sample
estimates for the mean and variance), i.e. N(12,9).
A 95% confidence interval then is 12 \pm  (1.96) 9 = 12 \pm  5.88
or 6.12 to 17.88 kg for N S \mu −\mu .
The unbiased estimate of ( ) N S \mu −\mu is 12 kg, and the interval (6.12, 17.88) contains
the true value of ( ) N S \mu −\mu with probability 0.95. There is strong evidence to say
that N is better than S.

It is possible that S may be better by 4%, but the upper limit is for N to be better by
24%.
