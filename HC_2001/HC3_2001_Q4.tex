Higher Certificate, Paper III, 2001. Question 4
If using a model based on polynomial trends, long-past observations still have some
influence on forecasts. Weighted averages of observations are useful, most recent
receiving largest weights. In (i), the forecast x (tˆ,1) uses weights (1 )j \alpha  −\alpha  which
decay exponentially to 0. The current observation, at j = 0, receives most weight. If
\alpha  = 1, the forecast is simply the current observation. This forecasting method only
uses at each step one previous value of x, one time-unit past, is quick and easy, and is
based on a statistical model where the first difference t t 1 x x − − is MA(1) in the errors.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  Using ( ) ( ) 2
1 2 ˆ ,1 1 (1 ) ... t t t x t \alpha  x \alpha  \alpha  x \alpha  \alpha  x − − = + − + − +
we have

1 2 3 1 ˆ 1,1 1 1 1 ... t t t \alpha  x t \alpha  \alpha  x \alpha  \alpha  x \alpha  \alpha  x − − − ∴ − − = − + − + − +
which gives
ˆ ( ,1) (1 ) ˆ ( 1,1) t x t =\alpha  x + −\alpha  x t −
{ ˆ ( 1,1)} ˆ ( 1,1) t=\alpha  x − x t − + x t − .

Forecast using
alpha = 0.25
(b) With \alpha  = 0.25, the forecast for week 3 sales is ¼(5618 − 5105) + 5105,
i.e. 5233; then for week 4 the forecast is ¼(5514 − 5233) + 5233, etc. Hence:
week 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
5105 5233 5303 5333 5511 5581 5545 5621
week 10 11 12 13
5779 5793 5780 5850
(c) Forecasts do not seem adequate as they frequently underestimate sales
by a large amount. Perhaps using a larger value of \alpha , to reduce the weight of
past history, would improve this model.
(d) Considering ˆ ( 1,1) tx − x t − as an error, and comparing its average size
on two models, would be a guide: we could use a root-mean-square
