Approximate 95\% confidence interval for p is pˆ ±1.96SE(pˆ ) , which is
0.125 ±1.96×0.015625, i.e. 0.125 ± 0.030625 or (0.0944, 0.1556).

the probability of obtaining pˆ ≤ 0.125 is approximately

\item The confidence interval for p did not include 1

small is consistent with rejecting a null hypothesis that p = 1
