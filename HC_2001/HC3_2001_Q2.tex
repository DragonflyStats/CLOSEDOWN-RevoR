Nitrogen 2 559139.25 279569.625
Depth 1 61206.00 61206.000

Both the nitrogen effect and the depth effect are obviously very highly significant.
Depth 12 gives a yield very significantly greater than depth 8. There is a very
significant nitrogen effect.
There is no evidence of interaction (F2,18 test statistic is 2.81).
(ii)
(iii) There will be considerably higher yield if 100kg of sulphate of ammonia per
acre is used, as compared with 50 or with none at all; and 12cm depth of winter
ploughing will give better results than 8cm. (The benefit of greater depth is about the
same whichever level of nitrogen is used.)
