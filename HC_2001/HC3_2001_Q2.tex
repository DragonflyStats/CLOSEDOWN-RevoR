2. The following data are from a two-factor experiment on sugar beet.  The two factors are nitrogen (0 kg, 50 kg and 100 kg sulphate of ammonia per acre) and depth of winter ploughing (8 cm and 12 cm).

(i) Complete the ANOVA table and use it to assess what evidence the experiment provides regarding the six treatment combinations.
 
(ii) Draw a simple diagram using the six mean values which illustrates the effects of nitrogen, ploughing depth and their interaction.  
 
(iii) Summarise your conclusions in non-technical language that the experimenter would understand.

Both the nitrogen effect and the depth effect are obviously very highly significant.
Depth 12 gives a yield very significantly greater than depth 8. There is a very
significant nitrogen effect.
There is no evidence of interaction (F2,18 test statistic is 2.81).
(ii)
(iii) There will be considerably higher yield if 100kg of sulphate of ammonia per
acre is used, as compared with 50 or with none at all; and 12cm depth of winter
ploughing will give better results than 8cm. (The benefit of greater depth is about the
same whichever level of nitrogen is used.)
