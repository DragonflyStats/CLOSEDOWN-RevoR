7. (a) The continuous random variable X is distributed with probability density function (pdf) f(x) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x). A random sample X1, X2, …, Xn is drawn from the distribution. Denote the
maximum value of the sample by Xmax and the minimum value by Xmin . (i) Note that Xmax ≤ x if and only if X1 ≤ x, X2 ≤ x, …, Xn ≤ x. Hence show that the cdf of Xmax is given by
( ) ( ) max

FX x = F x  .

(ii) By noting the condition under which $X_{min} ≥ x$, show that
( ) ( ) min 1 1 n

(iii) Deduce formulae for the probability density functions of Xmax and
Xmin in terms of F(x) and f(x).

\noindent (b) Suppose that the random variable X has the Pareto density given by
\[( ) ( ) ( )1 f x 1 x α α − + = + , x > 0 , α > 0.\]
Draw a graph of this density and show that the cdf is given by
F (x) 1 (1 x) −α = − + .
Deduce that the median of X is 21/α −1 .

Use result (a)(ii) above to obtain the cdf of the minimum of a random
sample of n observations distributed as is X, and verify that this cdf is also
of Pareto form but with a different parameter.

Taking $alpha = 1$, find the smallest value of n such that the median value of the
sample minimum is less than 0.1.

Cumulative distribution function
From the definition, the cumulative distribution function of a Pareto random variable with parameters $\alpha$ and xm is 
\[ {\displaystyle F_{X}(x)={\begin{cases}1-\left({\frac {x_{\mathrm {m} }}{x}}\right)^{\alpha }&x\geq x_{\mathrm {m} },\\0&x<x_{\mathrm {m} }.\end{cases}}} 
\]
Probability density function
It follows (by differentiation) that the probability density function is \[ {\displaystyle f_{X}(x)={\begin{cases}{\frac {\alpha x_{\mathrm {m} }^{\alpha }}{x^{\alpha +1}}}&x\geq x_{\mathrm {m} },\\0&x<x_{\mathrm {m} }.\end{cases}}} 
\]
\end{framed}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Using (a)(ii),
    
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{X_{min}} &=& 1 - \left( \frac{1}{(1+x)^\alpha} \right)^n    \\
&=& 1 - \left( \frac{1}{(1+x)^{n\alpha}} \right)
\end{eqnarray*}    
    also Pareto but with $\alpha$ replaced
by $n\alpha$.
The median of $X_{min}$ is then ${\displaystyle 2^{ \frac{1}{n\alpha}} -1 }$, which is ${\displaystyle 2^{ \frac{1}{n}} -1 }$ if $\alpha =1$. We require
$2^{ \frac{1}{n}} -1< 0.1$ or $2^{ \frac{1}{n}} < 1.1$, i.e.
 
\[ \frac{1}{n} \ln 2 < {\ln 1.1},\]
giving  

\[ n > \frac{\ln 2}{\ln 1.1} = \frac{0.6931}{0.0953} = 7.27.\]





Hence $n \geq  8$.
