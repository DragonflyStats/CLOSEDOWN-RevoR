\item  For $X_{min} X \geq  x$ , we require every $X_i$ to be $\geq  x$ for all $i$.
Now, ( ) ( ), so ( ) 1 ( ),  i P X \leq  x = F x P X \geq  x = - F x i
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) X_{min}  X_{min} 1 1 1 ,..., X n 


\begin{eqnarray*}
[F_{X_{min}} &=& P X( \leq  x ) \\
  &=&  1 - P( X \geq  x ) \\
  &=&  1- P(X_1 \geq  x,X_1 \geq  x,\ldots  X_n \geq  x)\\
  &=&  1- \left[ 1- F(X) \right]^{n}x 
\end{eqnarray*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Pdfs are derivatives of cdfs:

\begin{equation*}
f_{X_{min}}= n \left[ F(X) \right]^{n-1}f(x)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
f_{X_{min}}= n \left[ 1- F(X) \right]^{n-1}f(x)
\end{equation}

since $\frac{\partial F(X)}{\partial x } = f(x)\]

, also Pareto but with \alpha replaced
by $n\alpha$.
The median of $X_{min}$ is then
1
2n\alpha -1, which is 21/ n -1 if \alpha =1. We require
21/ n -1< 0.1 or 21/ n <1.1, i.e. 1 ln 2 ln1.1

Hence $n \geq  8$.
