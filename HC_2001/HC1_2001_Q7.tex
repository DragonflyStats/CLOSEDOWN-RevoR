7. (a) The continuous random variable X is distributed with probability density
function (pdf) f(x) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x). A
random sample X1, X2, …, Xn is drawn from the distribution. Denote the
maximum value of the sample by Xmax and the minimum value by Xmin .
(i) Note that Xmax ≤ x if and only if X1 ≤ x, X2 ≤ x, …, Xn ≤ x. Hence
show that the cdf of Xmax is given by
( ) ( ) max
n
FX x = F x  .

(ii) By noting the condition under which Xmin ≥ x, show that
( ) ( ) min 1 1 n
X F x = −  − F x  .

(iii) Deduce formulae for the probability density functions of Xmax and
Xmin in terms of F(x) and f(x).

(b) Suppose that the random variable X has the Pareto density given by
( ) ( ) ( )1 f x 1 x α α − + = + , x > 0 , α > 0.
Draw a graph of this density and show that the cdf is given by
F (x) 1 (1 x) −α = − + .
Deduce that the median of X is 21/α −1 .

Use result (a)(ii) above to obtain the cdf of the minimum of a random
sample of n observations distributed as is X, and verify that this cdf is also
of Pareto form but with a different parameter.

Taking α = 1, find the smallest value of n such that the median value of the
sample minimum is less than 0.1.

\item  For $X_{min} X \geq  x$ , we require every $X_i$ to be $\geq  x$ for all $i$.

\item Pdfs are derivatives of cdfs:

\begin{equation*}
f_{X_{min}}= n \left[ F(X) \right]^{n-1}f(x)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
f_{X_{min}}= n \left[ 1- F(X) \right]^{n-1}f(x)
\end{equation}

since $\frac{\partial F(X)}{\partial x } = f(x)\]

The median of $X_{min}$ is then
