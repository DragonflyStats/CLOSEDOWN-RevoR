2. At a recent fund-raising event, a game was devised in which contestants were invited to predict the number of sixes that would be obtained from the simultaneous rolling of five fair six-sided dice.  The organiser kept a record of the results from all 200 games played during the event and compiled the following table. 
 
Number of sixes   0   1   2 3 4 5 Number of games 90 78 26 4 1 1 
 
(i) Explain why the number of sixes obtained might be expected to follow a binomial distribution with parameters n = 5 and p = 1/6. (5)

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  If all dice are thrown "fairly" (and all are "fair" in construction), and throws
are independent, then the conditions for a binomial distribution are satisfied; p = 1/6
since there are six equally possible results, and n = 5, the "sample size" (number
thrown) each time. The number of "success" (sixes) is counted (R).

(ii) Test the hypothesis that the distribution of the number of sixes obtained is binomial with parameters n = 5 and p = 1/6, carefully explaining your conclusions. (15)

not significant as an observation from 2
3 χ (3 degrees of freedom since we are given
the value of p).
The null hypothesis is that R is binomial with n = 5, p = 1/6, and there is no evidence
that the observed frequencies depart seriously from those expected on this hypothesis.
We may assume the binomial model explains the data, and therefore the conditions
for a binomial do apply.
