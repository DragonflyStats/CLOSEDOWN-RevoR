8. The following data (x) are the number of plants per square metre obtained in an experiment where a particular type of grass seed was applied at four rates.  
The experiment was laid out as a completely randomised design. 
 
 Rate of application  1 2 3 4  29 180 332 910  13   90 444 880  21 120 190 460 Mean 21 130 322 750 Variance 64 2100 16204 63300 
 
(i) State the assumptions required for a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and whether these data appear to satisfy these assumptions.  Give reasons.  
 
(ii) The following three transformations have been suggested for these data: √x, loge(x) and (1/x).  
The following table contains values for the means and variances of the transformed data although some are missing.  
Complete the table and then say which of the transformations should be performed prior to carrying out a one-way ANOVA.  Give reasons.  
 
Transformation √x loge(x) 1/x Rate mean variance mean variance mean variance 1   4.52   0.79 2.992 0.1630 0.05301 **** 2 11.29   3.94 **** **** 0.00833 0.0000077 3 17.69 **** 5.716 0.1861 0.00351 0.0000025 4 27.09 23.96 6.575 0.1479 **** 0.0000004   (iii) Perform the ANOVA for the transformation chosen.  Sums of squares for the various transformations are: 
 SS x √x loge(x) 1/x Rates 928778 830.78 21.153 0.0053826 Total 1092114 915.16 22.389 0.0063478 
 
What conclusions do you draw from the ANOVA? 
 
 
(iv) Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the rate 3 mean value on the transformed scale.  Back-transform this interval onto the original scale.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The data should be Normally distributed about the respective treatment means;
and the variances of all the observations should be the same. The constant variance
condition is more important. For these data, the variances within the different
treatments are so different that this condition cannot be assumed. There is an obvious
relation between mean and variance, which a transformation may be able to correct
for.
\item  x : rate 3, variance = 13.49.
ln x : rate 2, mean = 4.827, variance = 0.1212.
1/ x : rate 1, variance = 0.0004721;
rate 4, mean = 0.00147.
The logarithmic transformation should be used, since it achieves approximately the
same variance for each rate and there is no evidence of a mean–variance relation.
\item 
SOURCE DF SS MS
Rates 3 21.153 7.051 F3,8 = 45.6
Residual 8 1.236 0.1545 = s2
TOTAL 11 22.389
Comparing 45.6 with F3,8, there is strong evidence of a difference among the means
for the various rates.
\item Rate 3: mean x = 5.716 , pooled variance from ANOVA = 0.1545 (8df).
Two-tailed 5% point of t8 is 2.571. r = 3. Limits are

This gives 5.716 2.571 0.1545 5.716 0.583

e5.133 =169.5; e6.299 = 544.0 [Note : e5.716 = 303.7 ]
