Higher Certificate, Paper II, 2001. Question 8
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  Total marks ranked in order of size from lowest:
197, 200, 203, 206, 210, 213, 217, 220, 223, 234, 237, 238, 245, 273, 290
q M Q
Median = 220. Lower quartile = 206 (or, with an alternative definition, ½(206 + 210)
= 208); upper quartile 238 (or 237 ½).
An alternative display marks the whisker ending at 273, with 290 shown as *. The
distribution is skew, since the median is not in the centre of the box and there is a very
long whisker to the right – although this is largely caused by the top two observations.
\item To compare the rank orders of Practical and Written, the 15 students' marks
need to be ranked and the difference in ranks, d, found. Then Spearman's coefficient
is ( )

Both this and the product-moment coefficient are significant at the 1% level, so there
is firm evidence that the practical and written marks increase together. The ranking
pattern is disturbed by (10), so reducing S r . The diagram shows a basically linear
relation with some noticeable scatter.
