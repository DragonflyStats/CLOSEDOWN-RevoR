Higher Certificate, Paper I, 2005. Question 3
\begin{enumerate}
\item P(T > t) = P(no failure in time t) = P(X = 0) = e−λ t .
\[\therefore 1 – F(t) = e−λ t \] and so the pdf of T is 

\[ \frac{dF (t )}{dt}d  d (e t ) e t
dt dt
= \frac{dF (t )}{dt} = − −λ =λ −λ .\]

\item P(all n systems still functioning at time t) = ( )

$\therefore$ the pdf of Tmin is
\[ \frac{dF (t )}{dt}d  d (e t ) e t
dt dt\] (for t > 0).
Thus Tmin is exponential with parameter nλ.

(Note that this is not exponential.)


\begin{itemize}
\item We now have n = 10 and λ = 0.002. 
\item We require t1 and t2 such that 1− e−nλ t1 = 0.05
and (1 2 ) 0.95. − e−λ t n =
\item \therefore 1− e−0.02t1 = 0.05 , giving 0.02t1 = –log(0.95) = 0.051293 
\item so that t1 = 2.565.
\item Also, 2 ( )1− e−0.002t = 0.95 1/10 = 0.994884 , giving 0.002t2 = –log(0.005116) = –5.2754
\item so that t2 = 2638.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
