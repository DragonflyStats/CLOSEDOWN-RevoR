\begin{framed}
3. The failures of a communications system occur in a Poisson process with rate
parameter λ, so that the random variable X giving the number of failures in time t
satisfies
( ) ( )( ) exp , 0,1, 2, ...
!
x t
P X x t x
x
λ
= = −λ = .
(i) By considering the probability that there is no failure in time t, or otherwise,
show that the probability distribution of the time T to the next failure is given
by
P(T > t ) = exp(−λt ), t > 0 ,
and deduce the probability density function (pdf) of T.
\end{framed}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \[P(T > t) = P(no failure in time t) = P(X = 0) = e^{-\lambda} t .\]
\[\therefore 1 - F(t) = e^{-\lambda} t \] and so the pdf of T is 

\[ \frac{dF (t )}{dt}  =  \frac{dF (e^{-\lambda\,t} )}{dt}  = \lambda\,e^{-\lambda\,t}\]


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\begin{framed}
(ii) A bank of n identical but independent communications systems of the above
type is set in operation at time 0, and Ti denotes the time to failure of the ith
system, i = 1, 2, …, n. Obtain an expression for the probability that all n
systems continue to function without failure for at least a time t. Deduce that
the pdf of Tmin = min(T1, …, Tn), the time to the first failure in the bank of n
systems, is of exponential form, with a rate parameter given by a function of n
and λ which should be stated.
\end{framed}
%----------------------------------------------------------------%
\item 
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\mbox{all n systems still functioning at time t}) &=& \prod^{n}_{i=1} P(T_i > t )\\
 &=& \prod^{n}_{i=1}  e^{-\lambda\,t}\\  
 &=& e^{-n\lambda\,t\} 
\end{eqnarray*} 
 


\therefore the pdf of Tmin is
\[ \frac{dF (e^{-\lambda\,t} )}{dt}  = \lambda\,e^{-\lambda\,t}\] (for t > 0).
Thus Tmin is exponential with parameter $n\,\lambda$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{framed}
(iii) Show that the probability that all n systems in the bank have failed by time t is
given by (1− e−λt )n , and deduce the pdf of Tmax = max(T1, …, Tn), the time to
the last failure in the bank of n systems.
Given that n = 10 and λ = 0.002, find the times 1 t and 2 t such that
( ) ( ) min 1 max 2 P T < t = P T > t = 0.05 .
(11)
\end{framed}
%----------------------------------------------------------------%
\item  P(all n systems have failed by time t) = ( ) ( )

\begin{eqnarray*}
\prod^{n}_{i=1} P(T_i > t )
 &=& \prod^{n}_{i=1}  e^{-\lambda\,t}\\  
 &=& e^{-n\lambda\,t\} 
\\ &=& - e^{-\lambda} t n , 
\end{eqnarray*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

and this is $P(Tmax) \leq t$.
\therefore the pdf of Tmax is 

\[ \frac{d}{dt}\left\{ \left(1-e^{-\lambda\,t} \right)^n  \right\}  =  n \lambda\,e^{-\lambda\,t} (1-e^{-\lambda\,t})^{n-1}\]


(for t > 0).
(Note that this is not exponential.)


\begin{itemize}
\item We now have $n = 10$ and $\lambda = 0.002$. 
\item We require $t_1$ and $t_2$ such that $1- e^{-n\lambda t_1} = 0.05$
and $(1- e^{-\lambda t_2})^n = 0.95$
  \item \therefore $1- e^{-n\lambda t_1} = 0.05$ , giving $0.02t_1 = –log(0.95) = 0.051293$ 
\item so that $t_1 = 2.565$.
\item Also, $(1- e^{-\lambda t_2}) = 0.95^{1/10} = 0.994884$ , giving $0.002t_2 = –log(0.005116) = –5.2754$
\item so that $t_2 = 2638$.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
