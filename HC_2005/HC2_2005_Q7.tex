There are k treatments, indexed by i = 1, 2, …, k. In the experiment or survey, there are ri units (individuals) in the ith group, i.e. receiving the ith treatment. yij is the observation (response) for the jth individual in group i.
μ is the overall population general mean. ti is the population mean effect (departure from μ) due to treatment i, with . 0iitΣ=
The Normally distributed residual (error) terms εij all have variance σ 2 and are uncorrelated (independent).
This is an additive model: the components add together, and together explain all the variation in the responses.
(ii) The "treatments" here are "high", "low" and "work". r1 = r2 = r3 = 12.
Totals are:

The grand total is 12793. ΣΣyij2 = 5719139.
"Correction factor" is 2127934546134.69436=.
Therefore total SS = 5719139 – = 1173004.306. 4546134.694
SS for treatments = 2225528375435114546134.694202067.056121212++−=.
The residual SS is obtained by subtraction.
Hence the analysis of variance table is as follows (SS and MS entries are slightly rounded).

The upper 5% point of F2,33 is about 3.3; the treatments effect is significant. There is evidence to reject the null hypothesis that all treatments have the same effect.
Solution continued on the next page
To investigate treatment differences, first calculate the treatment means, which are (in ascending order, for clarity)
Work : 292.58 Low : 312.83 High : 460.67
The least significant difference between any pair of these means is
333322942270.02612tt×= where 332.035at5%2.736at1%3.617at0.1%t⎧⎪=⎨⎪⎩
so the least significant differences are 142.50 for 5%, 191.59 for 1% and 253.28 for 0.1%. Thus the only apparent difference is that "high" gives a larger mean response than "low" and "work", judged at the 5% level; "low" and "work" do not differ.
Report
After carrying out an analysis which compares group means against internal variability of responses in the groups, we find some evidence that "high" shows more persistence than the other two groups, whose results are quite similar. The within-group variability is very high.
