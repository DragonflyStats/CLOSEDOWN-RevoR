The median m is given by F(m) = ½, so we have 1 – (1 – m)α = ½ or (1 – m)α = ½,
so that 1−m = 2−1/α , i.e. m =1− 2−1/α .

For the given sample, we have n = 5 and the values of 1 – xi are 0.88, 0.57, 0.93, 0.13
and 0.71. Therefore
Σlog(1 – xi) = –0.1278 – 0.5621 – 0.0726 – 2.0402 – 0.3425 = –3.1452

Also,

α = × = , so the confidence interval is (0.420, 2.759).
