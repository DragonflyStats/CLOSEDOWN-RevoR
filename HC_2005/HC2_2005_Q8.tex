Part (ii)
For overall consumption of alcohol, there was a slight increase over the time period as a whole, but not a very regular pattern.
Both for men and for women, the 16–24 age groups showed a distinct rise between the first two and the last two data sets (i.e. between 1992/94 and 1996/98).
Both for men and for women, the 65 and over age group showed a fall over the last two periods (i.e. from 1996 to 1998). This was also true of the 25–44 age groups, but the other age groups showed quite substantial increases.
Overall, there is a general decrease in consumption with age, though this is largely explained by markedly high 16–24 and low 65+ figures.
Overall, men drink two to three times as much as women.
