Higher Certificate, Paper II, 2005. Question 8

\begin{framed}
In a survey of British adults (those aged over 16), there were questions about alcohol consumption.  
One of these questions related to their average weekly alcohol consumption.  The table below shows trends in the distribution of average weekly alcohol consumption during the period 1992–1998. 
 
Average Weekly alcohol consumption by sex and age:  1992 to 1998 Persons aged 16 and over 
 
Age 1992 1994 1996 1998  Mean number of units per week Men     16–24 19.1 17.4 20.3 23.6 25–44 18.2 17.5 17.6 16.5 45–64 15.6 15.5 15.6 17.3 65 and over   9.7 10.0 11.0 10.7      Total 15.9 15.4 16.0 16.4           Women     16–24   7.3   7.7   9.5 10.6 25–44   6.3   6.2   7.2   7.1 45–64   5.3   5.3   5.9   6.4 65 and over   2.7   3.2   3.5   3.3      Total   5.4   5.4   6.3   6.4           All persons     16–24 12.9 12.3 14.7 16.6 25–44 11.8 11.4 11.9 11.4 45–64 10.2 10.2 10.5 11.6 65 and over   5.6   6.0   6.8   6.5      Total 10.2 10.0 10.7 11.0 
 
 
(i) Using the statistics given in the table, draw suitable diagrams to illustrate 
 
(a) the overall trend in alcohol consumption amongst men and women during the period 1992–1998, 
 
(b) similarities and differences between the 1998 age-specific alcohol consumption for males and females. (10) 
 
(ii) Write a short report, suitable for publication in a serious newspaper, based on the diagrams you have produced in part (i) and any other aspects of the data you consider relevant. (10)

\begin{itemize}
    \item For overall consumption of alcohol, there was a slight increase over the time period as a whole, but not a very regular pattern.
\item Both for men and for women, the 16–24 age groups showed a distinct rise between the first two and the last two data sets (i.e. between 1992/94 and 1996/98).
\item Both for men and for women, the 65 and over age group showed a fall over the last two periods (i.e. from 1996 to 1998). This was also true of the 25–44 age groups, but the other age groups showed quite substantial increases.
\item Overall, there is a general decrease in consumption with age, though this is largely explained by markedly high 16–24 and low 65+ figures.
\item Overall, men drink two to three times as much as women.
