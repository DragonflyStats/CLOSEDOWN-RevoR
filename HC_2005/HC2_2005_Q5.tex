Higher Certificate, Paper II, 2005. Question 5
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
(i) The two samples should be from independent Normal distributions with the same variance but possibly different means (the null hypothesis is usually that the two means are equal). The samples are random samples and are independent of each other.
    \item 
221112227;54.56,534.6956.14;49.29,261.3001.nxsnxs======
The "pooled estimate" of variance is s2 = 22112212(1)(1)11nsnsnn−+−−+− = 347.6355.
The test statistic for testing the null hypothesis 120μμ−=, where 1μ and 2μ are the respective population mean prices, is
121171405.270.6118.631xxs−−==+,
which is referred to t19. This is not significant, so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. There is no evidence that the true means in the two towns differ.
    \item  Town 1 has greater population and greater numbers of all types of properties, yet only half the sample size was used compared with town 2. The probabilities of selection in the two towns are thus very different. Also, the samples were restricted to the "Property Supplement" and to agents dealing in both towns. The assumption of randomness is doubtful, even whether we have representative samples. The test based on these data must be suspect for practical reasons, even if Normality and constant variance are acceptable. [The usual F6,13 test for equality of population variances gives a test statistic value of 2.05 which is not significant.]
\end{enumerate}
