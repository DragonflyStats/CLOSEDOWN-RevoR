8. The joint probability mass function of X and Y is tabulated below.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline 
   & Y= 0    & Y= 1    & Y= 2        \\ \hline \hline 
X= –1 & 1/6  & 1/12 & 1/12  \\ \hline 
X=  0 & 1/12 & 1/6  & 1/12  \\ \hline 
X=  1 & 1/12 & 1/12 & 1/6  \\ \hline 

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
(i) Obtain the marginal distributions of X and Y, and hence calculate E(X), E(Y),
Var(X) and Var(Y).
\end{framed}
%----------------------------------------------------------------%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The marginal distributions of X and Y are as shown, appended to the table.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline 
   & Y= 0    & Y= 1    & Y= 2    &    \\ \hline \hline 
X= –1 & 1/6  & 1/12 & 1/12 & 1/3 \\ \hline 
X=  0 & 1/12 & 1/6  & 1/12 & 1/3 \\ \hline 
X=  1 & 1/12 & 1/12 & 1/6  & 1/3 \\ \hline \hline 
   & 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3 & \\\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Marginal distribution of Y 
Hence E[X] = 0 and E[Y] = 1 (by symmetry; by noting that X and Y are both discrete
uniform; or by explicit calculation).
\[Var(X) = \sum(x – 0)^2P(X = x) = {(–1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2)/3 = 2/3.\]
Var(Y) can be calculated similarly; or, since Y = X + 1, we have Var(Y) = Var(X).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%----------------------------------------------------------------%
\begin{framed}
(ii) Obtain the conditional distribution of Y for each possible value of X, and hence
show that E(Y | X = x) is a linear function of x.
\end{framed}
%----------------------------------------------------------------%

\item The conditional distributions of Y for each value of X are as follows.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
   & Y= 0    & Y= 1    & Y= 2    &    \\ \hline \hline 
X= -1 & 1/2 &  1/4 & 1/4 \\ \hline 
X = 0 & 1/4 & 1/2 & 1/4 \\ \hline 
X = 1 & 1/4 & 1/4 & 1/2 \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


Hence $E[Y | X = –1] = (0)(0.5) + (1)(0.25) + (2)(0.25) = 3/4$.
Similarly, $E[Y | X = 0] = 1 and E[Y | X = 1] = 5/4$.
Thus we have $E[Y | X = x] = 1+ 4x$ .

(iii) Find E(XY) and deduce Cov(X, Y) and corr(X, Y). Are X and Y independent?
\end{framed}
%----------------------------------------------------------------%
\item 
\begin{eqnarray*} 
E[XY] = (–1)(0)(1/6) + (–1)(1)(1/12) + \ldots + (1)(2)(1/6) \\ &=&  1/6.
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
Cov(X, Y) &=& E[XY] – E[X]E[Y] \\ 
&=& 1
6 − (0)(1) \\ &=& 1/6\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}Corr(X, Y) \\ &=& \frac{Cov(X, Y)}{Var(X ) Var(Y  )}
\\ &=& \frac{1/6}{2/3} \\ &=& \frac{1/6}{2/3}
\end{eqnarray*}
X and Y are not independent: their correlation (or covariance) is non-zero. (In fact we
saw in part (i) that they are linearly related: Y = X + 1.)

(iv) Find the probability distribution of Z = X 3 + (Y – 1) 3.
\end{framed}
\item ( )Z = X 3 + Y −1 3 . The values of Z and their probabilities are as shown:
Y = 0 1 2
X = –1 Z = –2; p = 1/6 Z = –1; p = 1/12 Z = 0; p = 1/12
0 Z = –1; p = 1/12 Z = 0; p = 1/6 Z =1; p = 1/12
1 Z = 0; p = 1/12 Z =1; p = 1/12 Z = 2; p = 1/6
Thus we have
Values of Z –2 –1 0 1 2
Probabilities 1/6 1/6 1/3 1/6 1/6
\end{enumerate}
