4. The yields on the ordinary shares of 95 large United Kingdom companies at close of trading on 6 March 2003, as given in the Financial Times, were as follows.

You may treat the yields as constituting a random sample from a large population.

(i)
(ii) The modal class interval is "$\geq$ 4 but $<$5" (based, of course, on frequency
density; it would be "$\geq$ 5 but $<$7.5" if based only on frequency).
x = 439.25/95 = 4.62 (%).
For the median, we require the 48th observation from the beginning, which is
estimated as being at 4 + (4/19 × 1) = 4.21 (%).

(iii) Why is it only possible to estimate the mean, median and standard deviation rather than find them? 
\end{framed} 

(iii) These are only estimates because we have the data grouped into intervals, not
the 95 individual values.

(iv) Let p be the proportion of companies in the underlying population for which the shares yield 5 per cent or more.  Construct a 95\% confidence interval for $p$. 
\end{framed}
(iv) p is estimated by $\hat{p} = 32/95 = 0.337$. The estimated variance of $\hat{p}$ is
(0.337)(0.663)/95 = 0.002352, so the estimated standard deviation is 0.0485. Thus a
95\% confidence interval for $p$ is given by, approximately, $0.337 \pm (1.96)(0.0485)$, i.e.
it is (0.242, 0.432).\end{enumerate}
