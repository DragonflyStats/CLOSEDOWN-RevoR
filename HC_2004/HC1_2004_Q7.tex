, and this is also
P(longest offcut is ≤ x), i.e. the c.d.f. of the sample maximum (n) X . Thus the p.d.f. of
(n) X is the derivative of this, i.e. nxn–1/θ n. This is for the interval (0, θ ).

(iii) We have (see part (i)) that E(X) = θ /2. Thus the method of moments estimator
of θ /2 is X , and so the method of moments estimator of θ is 2X or 2
