 An experiment was conducted to investigate the toxic effects of four different chemical compounds A, B, C and D on the skin.  

Four adjacent regions, each a square of side 3 cm, were marked on the left forearm of each of six subjects, and each chemical was applied to each subject, 
choosing the sites of application of the chemicals at random for each subject.  

After three hours, the skin was examined and scored from 0 to 10 depending on the degree of irritation, with 0 representing no irritation and 10 severe irritation.  
The data are given in the following table. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
Subject 1 &  Subject 2 &  Subject 3&  Subject 4 &  Subject 5 & Subject 6 \\ \hline

D  5  &  A  7  &  B  2 &  B  4 & A  3 &  D  6  \\ \hline
B  3  & C  4 & A  1 & A  6&  B  1 & B  7 \\ \hline 
A  3  &   D  7 &  D  3 & C  6 &  D  2 &  C  3 \\ \hline
C  2  &  B  6 & C  1  & D  7 & C  2 & A  5  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
 
Carry out a suitable analysis of these data.  Explain clearly your conclusions and comment on the differences, if any, between the toxic effects of the compounds.  Discuss briefly whether all the necessary assumptions can safely be made. (14)

There are ν treatments and b blocks. yij is the observation (response) on the unit (plot)
in block j which receives treatment i. 0, 0 i i j j Στ = Σ β = (i.e. fixed effects model).
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mu$ is the overall population general mean, 
        \item $\tau_i$ the population mean effect due to
treatment $i$,    \item $\beta_j$ the population mean effect due to block $j$. 
    \item The Normally distributed
residual (error) terms $\varepsilon_{ij}$ all have variance $\sigma^2$ and are uncorrelated (independent).    \item All
non-random variation is covered by the $\tau_i$
 and $\beta_j$ terms.
\end{itemize}

\item The "blocks" here are subjects 1 to 6. The "treatments" are compounds A to
D. In the notation of part (i), ν = 4 and b = 6.

\begin{itemize}
\item The grand total is 96. $\sum \sum y_{ij}^2 =486$

\item The Correction factor is $ \frac{96^2}{24} = 384 $

\item Therefore $ \mbox{total }SS = 486 - 384 = 102$

\item The SS for blocks is

\begin{eqnarray*} 
 SS for blocks &=& \frac{13^2}{4} + \frac{24^2}{4} + \frac{7^2}{4} + \frac{23^2}{4} + \frac{8^2}{4} + \frac{21^2}{4} - 384\\
&=& 457 - 384 \\
&=& 73 \\
\end{eqnarray*}
\item The SS for treatments is

\begin{eqnarray*} 
\frac{25^2}{6} + \frac{23^2}{6} + \frac{18^2}{6} + \frac{30^2}{6} - 384\\
&=& 396.33 - 384 \\
&=& 12.33 \\
\end{eqnarray*}

\item The residual is obtained by subtraction.

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
The upper 0.1\% point of F5,15 is 7.57; the blocks effect is very highly significant.
The upper 5\% point of F3,15 is 3.29; the treatments effect is significant.

Clearly there are block (subject) differences. Even after removing these, the results are quite variable.
To investigate treatment differences, first calculate the treatment means, which are (in
ascending order, for clarity)
C : 3.00 B : 3.8333 A : 4.1667 D : 5.00
The least significant difference between any pair of these means is
15 15
2 1.111 0.6086


so the least significant differences are 1.30 for 5\%, 1.79 for 1\% and 2.48 for 0.1\%.
\item Thus the only apparent difference is between C and D, significant at the 1\% level.
The results must be interpreted with caution.
The data are on a 10-point scale of integers, so obviously cannot have an underlying
Normal distribution. 
\item However, when the means of 6 replicates are being compared,
the (necessarily approximate) results should give a good guide to likely treatment (i.e.
compound) differences.
Some of the subjects are considerably more prone to irritation than others. 
\item Because of
this, the underlying variances might be different in some blocks from others. This
would be contrary to an assumption in the modelling, and would thus be a further
feature making the results only approximate.
