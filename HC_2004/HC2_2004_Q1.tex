Higher Certificate, Paper II, 2004. Question 1
\begin{enumerate}
\item , 1, 2, ..., , 1, 2, ..., , { } ~ ind N(0, 2 ) ij i j ij ij y = μ +τ +β +ε i = ν j = b ε σ .
There are ν treatments and b blocks. yij is the observation (response) on the unit (plot)
in block j which receives treatment i. 0, 0 i i j j Στ = Σ β = (i.e. fixed effects model).
μ is the overall population general mean, τ
i the population mean effect due to
treatment i, β
j the population mean effect due to block j. The Normally distributed
residual (error) terms εij all have variance σ 2 and are uncorrelated (independent). All
non-random variation is covered by the τ
i and β
j terms.
\item The "blocks" here are subjects 1 to 6. The "treatments" are compounds A to
D. In the notation of part (i), ν = 4 and b = 6.
Totals are: Block 1 Block 2 Block 3 Block 4 Block 5 Block 6
13 24 7 23 8 21
Treatment A Treatment B Treatment C Treatment D
25 23 18 30
The grand total is 96. ΣΣyij
2 = 486.
"Correction factor" is
962 384

Therefore total SS = 486 – 384 = 102.
SS for blocks =
132 242 72 232 82 212 384 457 384 73

SS for treatments =
252 232 182 302 384 396.33 384 12.33

+ + + − = − = .
The residual SS is obtained by subtraction.

TOTAL 23 102.00
The upper 0.1% point of F5,15 is 7.57; the blocks effect is very highly significant.
The upper 5% point of F3,15 is 3.29; the treatments effect is significant.

Clearly there are block (subject) differences. Even after removing these, the results
are quite variable.
To investigate treatment differences, first calculate the treatment means, which are (in
ascending order, for clarity)
C : 3.00 B : 3.8333 A : 4.1667 D : 5.00
The least significant difference between any pair of these means is
15 15
2 1.111 0.6086

t × = t where 15
2.131 at 5%
2.947 at 1%

so the least significant differences are 1.30 for 5%, 1.79 for 1% and 2.48 for 0.1%.
Thus the only apparent difference is between C and D, significant at the 1% level.
The results must be interpreted with caution.
The data are on a 10-point scale of integers, so obviously cannot have an underlying
Normal distribution. However, when the means of 6 replicates are being compared,
the (necessarily approximate) results should give a good guide to likely treatment (i.e.
compound) differences.
Some of the subjects are considerably more prone to irritation than others. Because of
this, the underlying variances might be different in some blocks from others. This
would be contrary to an assumption in the modelling, and would thus be a further
feature making the results only approximate.\end{enumerate}
