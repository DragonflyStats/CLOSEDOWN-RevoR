    \item The 1-way analysis compares the N.H.“all ¹i are the same ”, where f¹ig denote
the means of the sores using the 4 points i=1,2,3,4; The A.H. is that there are differences
among the means

\item 
Assuming the scores can be modelled by a normal distribution, the linear model underlining
this analysis is y = ¹i +"ij ; f"ijg all N(0; ¾2). 
\item we do not reject the N.H. that all
¹iare the same.
\item If the columns repeat geographical differences, we should remove these in a 2-way analysis.
\item The area total are 343,321,336,370 and give a sum of square

\begin{itemize}
    \item Making allowance for area differences reduce the residual variation to that which is
purely random natural variation, so make the paints comparison more precise. 
\item Now the
N.H.should be rejected. there is evidence of a different among the paints.
