\begin{itemize}
    \item With few intervals, the histogram alone is not very informative, but the mean and median are
roughly the same, and near to the middle of the range of the data. \item Therefore we may treat the
data as approximately normal, and certainly as sufficiently symmetrical to use large-sample tests.
