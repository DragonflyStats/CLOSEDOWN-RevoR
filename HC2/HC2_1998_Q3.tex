\begin{enumerate}
\item If we can assume that the lifetime distribution for the bulbs is normal with variance ¾2,
and all observations are independent of one another, then (n ¡ 1)s2=¾2 will be distributed Â2
n¡1.
Here n=10, and on H0 we take ¾2 = 1502. Then effectively we test H0 : ¾2 · 1502 against
H1 : ¾2 > 1502.
For the data,(n ¡ 1)s2 = 9 £ 35410:99. Hence Â2
(9) = 14:16, which is not significant at the 5%
level. Therefore we do not have enough evidence to reject H0 which says ¾ · 150.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Since twelve randomly selected batches were used from each process we have independent estimates
of variances ¾2
1, ¾2
2. The Null Hypothesis will be ¾2
1 = ¾2
2, and AH ¾2
1 > ¾2
2.
\begin{itemize}
\item From the data, s21
= 0:012536 and s22
= 0:003590.
\item Assuming that the distributions of impurity levels are normal, s21
=s22
is distributed as F(11,11).
s21
s22
= 3:49¤, significant at the 5% level so that H0 is rejected in favor of H1: there is evidence of a
reduction in process variability.
