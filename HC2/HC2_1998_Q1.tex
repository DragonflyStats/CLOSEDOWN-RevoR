®i and ¯j are deviations from the general mean, due to which treatment has been given and
which block the unit(plot) is in; these are independent of one another.
f²ijg are mutually independent random residual terms, representing natural variation between
experimental units, each distributed normally with mean C and (constant) variance ¾2.

Analysis of Variance:
SOURCE D:F: SUM OF SQUARES M:S:
Treatments 2 22:167 11:084 F(2; 6) = 8:49¤
Locations 3 53:667 17:889 F(3; 6) = 13:70¤¤
Residuals 6 7:883 1:306
TOTAL 11 83:667
The locations differed significantly, and therefore it was useful to use the randomized block scheme
with locations as blocks. We assume there is no blocks £ treatments interaction.
For treatments, means are: A 11:75
C 12:00
B 14:75
. We are not told which comparisons(contrasts) among
treatments are important, but it is clear that the significance of F(2,6) must be due to the difference
between B and the other two.
