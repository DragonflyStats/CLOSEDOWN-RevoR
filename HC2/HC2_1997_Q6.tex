\begin{document}If we assume the data follow a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance ¾2,
then we can use the data (16 observations) to test the Null Hypotheses that
(i) ¹ ¸ 400, (ii) ¾2 · 64 against the Alternatives ¹ < 400 and ¾2 > 64.
The mean of the sample is $\bar{x}$ = 396:125 and variance $s^2 = 77.9833$.


\begin{enumerate}
    \item For the mean, t(15) = p396:125¡400
77:9833=16
= ¡3:875
2:208 = ¡1:76, which is just on the
borderline of significance at 5% in a 1-tail test. The evidence from these
data is that the mean is not likely to be ¸ 400.
\item For the variance, (n¡1)s2
¾2 » Â2(
n¡1) i.e. 15£77:9833
64 is Â2
(15) = 18:28, which is
less than the 5% (upper) point of Â2
(15), so there is no evidence to reject the
hypothesis that ¾2 · 64, even though the observed value is above this.
\begin{itemize}
\item With a sample four times as large, i.e. n = 64, assuming the same estimates
$\bar{x}$ and $s^2$, t(63) would be
p
4, i.e. 2, times as large, providing very strong
evidence against the Null Hypothesis for ¹. The variance would be based
on 63 d.f., and the Â2 statistic would be 63£77:9833
64 = 76:76, which is not
significant and so there is still no evidence against the Null Hypothesis for
¾2.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
