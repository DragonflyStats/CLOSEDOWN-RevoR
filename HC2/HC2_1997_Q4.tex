31£29£15 = 0:00126.
\begin{itemize}
    \item For a 2-tail test of the Null Hypothesis of no difference, the probability is
2(0:08664+0:01702+0:00126) = 0:2098. 
\item There is no significant evidence for
any difference between the two drugs.

\end{itemize}

(B) The Â2
(1) test also tests the N. H. that the proportions recovering are the
same on each drug. ‘Expected’ frequencies are those given by this N. H. with
the same marginal totals as the ‘Observed’.

Again there is no significant evidence against the N. H.


(ii) 
\begin{itemize}
\item The inference is the same in this, rather small, trial whether or not the
drop-outs are included. 
\item There were 11 drop-outs on each drug, which is a
considerable proportion of patients beginning the trial; 
\item however, no particular
reasons for drop-out are known.
