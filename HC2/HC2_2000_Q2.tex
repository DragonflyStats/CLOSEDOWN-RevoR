2 N=48 mice, Table of results is:
survival : No Y es
control : 14(10:5) 10(13:5) 24
Drug 7(10:5) 17(13:5) 24
21 27 48
values in brackets are the frequencies expected on the null hypothesis that survival rates
are the same in both groups of mice.

Yates’ correction can sometimes over-correct for continuity (discreteness). so the ”exact”
probability of obtain the results on the N.H.-which could be found by Fisher’s
Exact Test-is found about the 5% value(3.84). this leaves the significance or otherwise
10
of the result in doubt, but indicates that further data would be needed before a clear
decision could be made. 48 is a very small number of units upon which to compare two
proportions.
For the second trial, N=144, and the results are:
survival : No Y es
control : 42(31:5) 30(40:5) 72
Drug 21(31:5) 51(40:5) 72

x(1)

and with Yates’ correction,the value of X2
(1): is 102( 2
31:5 + 2
40:5 ) = 11:29
Both values are significant at the 0.1% lever, leaving little doubt that there is a difference
between Control and Drug.
since we are only asked to test ”the effect” of the drug a 1-tail test may not be valid;
but the data from the second experiment show a firm indication in favor of the drug.
