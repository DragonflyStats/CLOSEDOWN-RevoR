\section{Introduction}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item (i) In the model yij = u + ®i + "ij , the response yij on the jM unit under ”treatment” i
contains:
U=a general mean response,
®i=an effect, or departure from general mean,due to treatment i,
"ij=random residual ”error”term, N » (0; ±2), with constant ±2, mutually independent
for all i,j.
The model is assumed additive. The standard assumptions thus are additivity, normality,
constant variance.
\item H0 is ”u1 = u2 = u3”, and the alternative H1 is that at least one is different from the
others.
Total for treatments: 1:161, 2:195, 3:180. Grand total=536

The milk yield for treatment 2 (using supplement A)gave the highest average in this
trial. But it should be noted that when allowance is made for the variation between
individual animals the statistical evidence only indicates that this treatment is better
than ”no supplement”. The position for supplement B remains in doubt.
