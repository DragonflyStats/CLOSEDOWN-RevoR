Although results 1 are rounded to whole numbers, analysis of variance will
have to assume that all observations on all treatments have the same variance
¾2. Also the material used in the trial should have been selected at
random from what was available, and the samples examined under identical
conditions in random order.

We are not given any specific contrasts among storages to be tested, but
even if the whole Treatments S:S: were due to one contrast this would still
not be significant as F(1;13) ( 19:11
7:566 = 2:52, less than the 5% point 4.67). We
may say confidently, that there are no significant differences among these
“Treatments”.
(ii) Given the result in (i), there could be no change to the inference. [In a
borderline case, some intelligence in looking at individual differences may be
called for, as ¾2 may be slightly overestimated.]
