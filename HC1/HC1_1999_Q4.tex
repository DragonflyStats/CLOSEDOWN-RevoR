\item  (a) The sampling method does not collect any data for which y=0. Hence in this distribution
1P
y=1
P(y) = 1
%------------------%
\begin{itemize}
\item But since we have a Poisson distribution originally we know that P(y = 0) =
e¡u;andP(y ¸ 1) = 1 ¡ e¡u:
\item This the total probability for the data that have been collected is 1¡e¡u, and each
individual probability must be expressed as a proportion of this in order to make
them add to 1.
\item 
Therefore P(Y = y) = e¡uuy
\end{itemize}

1¡e¡u = u
\item Hence the sample fraction of leaves with just one insect, subtract from the sample
mean (which is an unbiased estimate of E[Y]) gives an unbiased estimate of u.
