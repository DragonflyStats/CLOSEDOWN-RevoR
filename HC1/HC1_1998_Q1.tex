\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item The probabilities of reading the three newspapers are
\begin{itemize}
\item P(A) = 1/3
\item P(B) = 1/2 
\item P(C)= 1/6 
\end{itemize}

Let $E$ be the event that an early is made.
$P(E|A)=0.02$, $P(E|B)=0.01$, $P(E|C)=0.05$ .
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(E) &=& P(E|A)P(A) + P(E|B)P(B) + P(E|C)P(C)\\
&=& (0.02 \times  1/3 ) + (0.01 \times  1
/2 ) + (0.05 \times  1/6 )\\
&=& \frac{1}{6}(0.04 + 0.03 + 0.05)
\\&=& \frac{0.12}{6}
 \\ &=& 0.02
\end{eqnarray*}
Since all entries are correct, the probability of winning is $P(A|E)$,$P(B|E)$,$P(C|E)$ respectively for
readers of A, B, C.

\[P(A|E)P(E) =   P(E|A)P(A) \] 

\[P(A|E) = \frac{P(A|E)P(E)}{P(A)}\]
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A|E) &=& \frac{0.02\times (1/3)}{0.02} 
\\&=&  1/3 
\end{eqnarray*}
\[P(B|E)=\frac{P(E|B)P(B)}{P(E)}=\frac{0.01\times( 1/2)}{0.02} = \frac{1}{4}\]

\[P(C|E)=\frac{P(E|C)P(C)}{P(E)}=\frac{0.05\times( 1/6)}{0.02} = \frac{5}{12}\]

[Check: these must sum to 1 .

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Since the readerships are large, we may ignore the need for a finite population correction, and
so the required probability will be \[ \left( \frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Similarly, for any two different newspapers, in either order for first, second, the probability
will be: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Prob &=& 2 \left[\left( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{4} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{5}{12} \right)\right]\\
&=& \left( \frac{2}{12} + \frac{10}{36} + \frac{10}{48} \right) \\
&=& \left( \frac{12}{72} + \frac{20}{72} + \frac{15}{72} \right) \\
&=& \frac{47}{72} \\
&=& 0.653
\end{eqnarray*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There are 6 possible orders for one each of A, B, C, so the probability is \[6\times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{4}\times  \frac{5}{12}
 = \frac{5}{24} = 0.208 \]
\end{enumerate}
