\section{Introduction}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A binomial distribution with large n and very small p may be approximated
by a Poisson with ¹ = np. 
\begin{itemize}
\item It is desirable that np should be at least 5, but in
addition n should be ¸ 20 and p · 0:1. 
\item When all these conditions are met
the approximation will be a good one.
\end{itemize}

\item  A Poisson with large mean can be approximated by N(¹; ¹). The
approximation will be good for ¹ ¸ 10, but adequate down to ¹ = 5.

(b) (i) Poisson, mean 5:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(4) + P(5) + P(6) &=& 
e¡5( 54

\end{eqnarray*}

\item  N(5; 5) with a continuity correction is required: find P(31

N(5; 5). Corresponding r-values are 3 1

= +0:6708.
\[P(z < ¡0:6708) = P(z > +0:6708) = 0:25117,\] and so the required probability
is 1 ¡ 2 £ 0:25117 = 0:49766. The error is 0.0005, and % error
0:0005
0:49716 £ 100 = 0:1%:
Using the continuity correction with ¹ = 5, and calculating values which we
near to the mean, leads to a very good approximation.
\item  P(0) = e¡¸t = P(T > t) for the first event observed = 1 ¡ F(t). Hence
F(t) = 1 ¡ e¡¸t and g(t) = F
0(t) = ¸e¡¸t. (t ¸ 0; ¸ > 0).
[g(t) = 0 unless t ¸ 0; ¸ > 0 since neither time of events nor rate of events
occurring can be negative.] Use integration by parts.


\begin{eqnarray*}
E(T) &=& \int^{\infty}_{0} \lambda t\;e^{-\lambda} dt \\
    &=&\int^{\infty}_{0} \lambda t\;e^{-\lambda} dt \\
    &=& \left[ -\frac{1}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda t} \right]^{\infty}_{0}\\
    &=& \frac{1}{\lambda}  
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
E(T^2) &=& \int^{\infty}_{0} \lambda t^2\;e^{-\lambda} dt \\
    &=&\int^{\infty}_{0} \lambda t^2\;e^{-\lambda} dt \\
    &=& \left[ -\frac{1}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda t} \right]^{\infty}_{0}\\
    &=& \frac{2}{\lambda}E(T)\\
    &=& \frac{2}{\lambda^2}  
\end{eqnarray*}

\[ Var(X) = [E(X^2)] - [E(X)^2] = \frac{2}{\lambda^2} - \frac{1}{\lambda^2} 
     = \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \]

\begin{itemize}
\item $\lambda = 5$, so that $E[T] = 0.2$ and $V[T] = 0.04$. 

 For n = 100, a sample mean
$\bar{T}$ is approximately $N(0.2; \frac{0:04}{100})$, and the range required is from 0.18 to 0.22,
within 10\% of 0.2. 
\item The corresponding values of r are 0p:18¡0:2
0:0004
= ¡0:02
0:02 = ¡1,
and the other = +1. 
\item $P(r > 1) = 0:1587 = P(r < -1)$ and so the probability
between these values is 1 ¡ 2 £ 0:1587 = 0:6826.
