\item A binomial distribution with large n and very small p may be approximated
by a Poisson with $\lambda = np$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item It is desirable that $np$ should be at least 5, but in
addition n should be greater than 20 and p less than 0.1.

\item When all these conditions are met
the approximation will be a good one.
\end{itemize}

\item  A Poisson with large mean can be approximated by $N(\mu, \mu)$. The
approximation will be good for $\mu \geq 10$, but adequate down to $\mu = 5$.

Using the continuity correction with ¹ = 5, and calculating values which we
near to the mean, leads to a very good approximation.

(c) Events happen in a Poisson process at rate

λ t .  Write down
the probability that there are no events in the interval ( , ) 0 t .  By interpreting this probability as the chance that the time T to the next event in the process is greater than t, show that the probability density function (pdf) of T is given by

\item  $P(0) = e^{-\lambda t}¸ = P(T > t)$ for the first event observed = $1 - F(t)$. Hence
$F(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}$ and g(t) = F
0(t) = ¸e¡¸t. (t ¸ 0; ¸ > 0).
[g(t) = 0 unless t ¸ 0; ¸ > 0 since neither time of events nor rate of events
occurring can be negative.] 


Use integration by parts.


\begin{eqnarray*}
E(T) &=& \int^{\infty}_{0} \lambda t\;e^{-\lambda} dt \\
    &=&\int^{\infty}_{0} \lambda t\;e^{-\lambda} dt \\
    &=& \left[ -\frac{1}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda t} \right]^{\infty}_{0}\\
    &=& \frac{1}{\lambda}  
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
E(T^2) &=& \int^{\infty}_{0} \lambda t^2\;e^{-\lambda} dt \\
    &=&\int^{\infty}_{0} \lambda t^2\;e^{-\lambda} dt \\
    &=& \left[ -\frac{1}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda t} \right]^{\infty}_{0}\\
    &=& \frac{2}{\lambda}E(T)\\
    &=& \frac{2}{\lambda^2}  
\end{eqnarray*}

\[ Var(X) = [E(X^2)] - [E(X)^2] = \frac{2}{\lambda^2} - \frac{1}{\lambda^2} 
     = \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \]

(d) In the case

\begin{itemize}
\item $\lambda = 5$, so that $E[T] = 0.2$ and $V[T] = 0.04$. 

\item For n = 100, a sample mean
$\bar{T}$ is approximately $N(0.2; \frac{0.04}{100})$. The range required is from 0.18 to 0.22,
within 10\% of 0.2. 
\item The corresponding values of r are $\frac{0.18- 0.20}{\sqrt{0.0004}} = -\frac{0.002}{0.002} = -1$,
and the other = +1. 
\item $P(r > 1) = 0.1587 = P(r < -1)$ and so the probability
between these values is $1 - (2 \times 0.1587) = 0.6826$.
