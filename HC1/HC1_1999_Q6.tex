\begin{enumerate}
    \item P(device fails) = P(both components faulty) = p2, by independence.
    
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hence P(device works) =
1-p2. 
\item Again assuming independence of performance of individual devices, R is Binomial
(n; 1 - p2)
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item For line A, $P(\mbox{device faulty}) = 1/4$; and for B; $P(\mbox{faulty}) = 1/9$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item  Let event F denote failure/faulty.
$P(F|A) = 1/4$; $P(F|B) = 1/9$; from (ii)

(a) If $P(A) = P(B) = 1=2$; 
\[P(A|F) = \frac{P(F|A)P(A)}{P(F)}\] 
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(F) &=&  P(F|A)P(A)+P(F|B)P(B) \\ 
&=& \left[\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} \right] + \left[\frac{1}{9} \times \frac{1}{2} \right] 
&=& 9/13
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A|F) = \frac{P(F|A)P(A)}{P(F)} \\ 
&=& \frac{\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2}}{P(F)}
&=& 9/13
\end{eqnarray*}

\item  If $P(A) = 1/4$; $P(B) = 3/4$; $P(A|F) = 3/7$
Although individually devices from A are more likely to fail, in case(b) more devices
are made on line B which results in a higher probability for(b).
