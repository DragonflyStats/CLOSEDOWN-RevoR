An electronic device consists of two identical components which each have, independently, probability p of being faulty.  The device works unless both components are faulty.  A random sample of n devices is checked. 
 
(i) Write down the probability distribution of R, the number of devices found to work. \\

There are two separate production lines.  Line A uses components from factory A for which p = 1/2 and line B uses components from factory B for which p = 1/3.  Calculate the probability that a randomly chosen device from the output of line A is found to be faulty, and make the corresponding calculation for line B.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item P(device fails) = P(both components faulty) = p2, by independence.
    
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hence P(device works) =
1-p2. 
\item Again assuming independence of performance of individual devices, R is Binomial
(n; 1 - p2)
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item For line A, $P(\mbox{device faulty}) = 1/4$; and for B; $P(\mbox{faulty}) = 1/9$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item  Let event F denote failure/faulty.

(iii) A device is chosen at random from the combined output of both production lines and is found to be faulty.  Find the probability that the faulty device came from line A,

$P(F|A) = 1/4$; $P(F|B) = 1/9$; from (ii)

(a) If $P(A) = P(B) = 1=2$; 
\[P(A|F) = \frac{P(F|A)P(A)}{P(F)}\] 
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(F) &=&  P(F|A)P(A)+P(F|B)P(B) \\ 
&=& \left[\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} \right] + \left[\frac{1}{9} \times \frac{1}{2} \right] \\
&=& 9/13
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A|F) &=& \frac{P(F|A)P(A)}{P(F)} \\ 
&=& \frac{\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2}}{P(F)}\\
&=& 9/13

Although individually devices from A are more likely to fail, in case(b) more devices
are made on line B which results in a higher probability for(b).
