6. The lengths X of offcuts of timber in a carpenter’s workshop follow the continuous uniform distribution with probability density function (pdf)

\item Sampled items chosen at random, hence fXig are independent. 
\begin{itemize}
\item P(X · x) =
x
$\mu$ for each item, all are required to be · x, so probability for n items is (x
$\mu$ )n,
when 0 · x · $\mu$. 
\item This is F(X(n)), where X(n) is the sample maximum, and
so f(x(n)) = F
0(x(n)) = nxn¡1
$\mu$n , when 0 · x · $\mu$, =0 otherwise.
\item E[X(n)] =

\item The likelihood of a sample fx1; ¢ ¢ ¢ ; xng is 1

\item Setting $\hat{\mu} = X(n)$, where is the lowest value of $\mu$ possible on the evidence of
the sample values, gives the largest possible value of the likelihood.
\item  Hence X(n) is the m.l. estimator.

\item Method of moments estimator $\hat{\mu}$ is found from setting $\bar{x} = E[x]$, i.e., $\bar{x} = 1/2$

\item n+1
n X(n) is unbiased, and X(n) very nearly so if n is at all large; their
variances are much smaller than that for $\hat{\mu}$, the estimator based on the mean.
Hence, use X(n) if there are a reasonable number of offcuts; if only few,
multiply by the factor n+1
