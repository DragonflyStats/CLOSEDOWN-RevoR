For $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, let $X_i$ be Normally distributed with mean $\mu_i$ i and variance $\sigma^2_i$, and let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be independent.  If $a_1, a_2, \ldots$, an are any 
non-zero constants, state the distribution of 
\[  \sum^{n}_{i=1} a_iX_i\] .  Deduce the 
distribution of $X_1 + X_2$ and $X_1 - X_2$ .

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
Linear combinations of normal variables remain normal.
\[
y \sim N( \sum^{n}_{i=1} a_iX_i;  \sum^{n}_{i=1} a_iX_i)
i \sigma^2
i )\]
Hence $x1 + x2 \sim N(\mu_1 + \mu_2; \sigma^2_1 + \sigma^2_2)$; $x1 - x2 \sim N(\mu_1 - \mu_2; \sigma^2_1 + \sigma^2_2)$

(b) An office manager takes, on average, 35 minutes to get to work;  his travelling time is Normally distributed with standard deviation 4 minutes.  His secretary takes, on average, 33 minutes to get to work;  her travelling time is Normally distributed with standard deviation 3 minutes.  Stating any further assumptions you make, find 
 
(i) the probability that the manager reaches work before his secretary, supposing that they leave their homes at the same time, 
 
(ii) how much earlier the secretary must leave her home to be 90\% certain of getting to work before her manager, (3) 
 
(iii) the probability that both get to work within 30 minutes of the times at which they set out. (3)

\item Let M,S be travelling times of manager and secretary.
$M \sim N(35; 16)$ and $S \sim N(33; 9)$
(i)Assuming journey times are independent ,
$M - S \sim N(2; 25)$ and $P(M - s < 0) = P(z <
\frac{0 - 2}{5}$
where $z \sim N(0.; 1)$; this is $P(z < -0.4) = 0.3446$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item If secretary leaves t minutes earlier, the difference in arrival times will be $N(2+t,25)$,assuming
that the journey times still have the same distributions as before.
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(secretary arrives first) &=& P(M - S + t > 0)\\
&=& 1 - \Phi (\frac{1(2+t)}{5}) \geq¸ 0.9 if

\begin{eqnarray*}

(c) In an office there are 20 computers, each of which has, independently of the rest, a Poisson incidence of breakdowns at the rate of 0.02 per week.  Breakdowns are invariably repaired with negligible delay.  Find the probabilities that 
 
(i) a period of 4 weeks passes with no breakdowns, 

 
(ii) in a period of 4 weeks there is at least one breakdown each week. 
 
Use a suitable approximation to calculate the probability of more than 26 breakdowns over a 52 week period.   
 \\ \hline 
      \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
\item  The number of breakdowns per week will follow a poisson distribution with mean
$20 \times 0.02 = 0.4$
\item 
\[P(\mbox{no breakdowns}) = e^{-0.4}\]
\[P(\mbox{none in 4 weeks}) = (e^{-0.4})4 = e-1:6 = 0.2019\]
\item 
\[P(1 or more in a week) = 1 - e^{-0.4} = 0.39297\]
required probability = $(0.3297)^4 = 0.0118$
\begin{itemize}
    \item In 52 weeks, number of breakdowns in poisson with mean $0.4 \times 52 = 20.8$ 
    \item A normal
approximation $N(20.8,20.8)$ may be used, and using a continuity correction we
require $P(number > 26.5)$
\end{itemize}

z = 26p:5-20.8
20.8 = 5:7

P(z > 1.2498) 
&=& P(z < -1.2498) \\
