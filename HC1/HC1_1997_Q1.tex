1. (a) (i) Four men wish to play doubles tennis.  In how many different ways can they choose which two play against the other two?
If two men and two women wish to play mixed doubles (a pair consisting of one man and woman against the other man and woman), how many different mixed doubles matches can be formed from these four people?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  Label the 4 men $$\{A,B,C,D\}$. Then A may have B or C or D as partner; the
other two are the opposing pair. There are 3 ways. [Alternatively

\[ \frac{{ 4 \choose 2}}{2} = 3.\] 

Label the players $\{M_1,M_2,W_1,W_2\}$. Then $M_1$ may play with W1 or $W_2$ as
partner; M2 then has the other woman as partner. There are 2 ways.

\item Suppose $n = 4m$. (If it is not, then 1 or 2 or 3 players cannot take part).
\begin{itemize}
\item Groups of 4 can be chosen in ( 4m
4 ) ways, and each group can be matched
in 3 ways (as above) giving a total of 3( 4m
4 ), where 4m is the multiple of 4
that is as near to n (below) as possible.
\item Suppose n1 = 2m1 (otherwise leave out one man) and n2 = 2m2 (otherwise
leave out one woman).
\item Two of each sex may be chosen in ( 2m1
2 ) ¢ ( 2m2
2 ) ways and the total number
of matches is then 2( 2m1
2 ) ¢ ( 2m2
2 ).
\end{itemize}
\item $\displaymode{ {10 \choose 5}}$ = 252, as once the first 5 are chosen the teams are chosen completely.

(b) (i) In how many ways can 10 footballers be divided into 2 five-a-side teams?
(ii) In how many ways can the two teams be formed if there are only 2 goalkeepers among the 10 players and the goalkeepers have to play on opposing sides?

(iii) There are only 2 goalkeepers and 3 strikers (all different people) among the 10 players.  In how many ways can the two teams be formed if each team must have one goalkeeper and at least one striker? \\ \hline

\item Teams each consist of a goalkeeper and 4 others. Team 1 can be completed
in $\displaymode{ {8 \choose 4}}$  ways =70 ways, which defines the selection completely.
\item  Label the goalkeepers $\{G_1,G_2\}$, the strikers S1; S2; S3. Then these are 5 other
players.


\begin{itemize}
    \item We may have, in one team, G1 with S1 or S2 or S3 and choose the other 3 from 5: there are 3 £$\displaymode{ {5 \choose 3}}$ = 30 ways for this. 
    \item  Also G1 may have two of the strikers and two others in the same team.
    \item There are $\displaymode{ {3 \choose 2}}$  = 3 ways for
strikers and$\displaymode{ {5 \choose 2}}$ = 10 ways for others, making 30 ways in all. 
    \item The total number of ways is thus 30 + 30 = 60. Choosing one team fixes the other.
