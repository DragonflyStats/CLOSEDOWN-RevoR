1 Outcome probabilities are:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item  $P(H|B) = 1/2$ and so $P(T|A)$ = $P(T|B) = 1/2$ .
\begin{itemize}
\item Hence every entry in the body of the table is the product of marginal probabilities (by
independence),$1/2 \times 1/2 = 1/4$.
\item Writing GA = Gain for A;GB = Gain for B ,
\item $E[G_A] = (3 \times 1/4) - (2 \times 1/4) - (2 \times 1/4) + (1 \times 1/4) = 0 = E[G_B]$
since this is a two person game.
\end{itemize}

\item $E[G_A] = (3 \times 2/9) - (2 \times 4/9) - (2 \times 1/9) + (1 \times 2/9) = -2/9$
\item giving 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E[G_A] &=& 3p_Ap_B - 2p_A(1  p_B) - 2(1 - p_A)p_B + (1 - p_A)(1 - p_B)\\ &=& 1 - 3p_A -
3p_B + 8p_Ap_B\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{itemize}
\item If $p_B = 3/8$ ;$E[GA] = 1 - 3p_B$ from the first alternative form; in this case \[E[G_A] =
1 - \frac{9}{8}  = - \frac{1}{8}\]
\item Hence choose to play as B, with $p_B = 3/8$ ,which in the long run will guarantee a win of $1/8$
(since $E[G_B] = -E[G_A]$)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
