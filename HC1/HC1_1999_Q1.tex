1. The game of Snip is played for marbles.  In this game two players, A and B say, each have a coin which, unseen by the other player, they independently choose to display as Heads (H) or Tails (T).  When A and B have made their choices, the coins are disclosed and the outcome of the game is decided in accordance with the table below.

 
(i) Suppose that A and B independently both randomly display H and T with probability 1/2.  Show that all four outcome combinations in the table above have the same probability, and deduce that the expected gain to A (or B) is zero. (6)

% Please add the following required packages to your document preamble:

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\multicolumn{2}{l}{}   & \multicolumn{2}{l}{B displays} \\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{}   & H      & T      \\
\multirow{2}{*}{A displays} & H & A wins 3 from B & B wins 2 from A \\
       & T & B wins 2 from A & A wins 1 from B
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


1 Outcome probabilities are:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
 \item  $P(H|B) = 1/2$ and so $P(T|A)$ = $P(T|B) = 1/2$ .
\begin{itemize}
\item Hence every entry in the body of the table is the product of marginal probabilities (by
independence),$1/2 \times 1/2 = 1/4$.
\item Writing GA = Gain for A;GB = Gain for B ,
\item $E[G_A] = (3 \times 1/4) - (2 \times 1/4) - (2 \times 1/4) + (1 \times 1/4) = 0 = E[G_B]$
since this is a two person game.
\end{itemize}

 (ii) Suppose now that A and B independently both randomly display H and T, but A displays H and T with respective probabilities 2/3 and 1/3 while B displays H and T with respective probabilities 1/3 and 2/3.  Calculate the four outcome probabilities under these conditions and find the expected gain to A. (6) 
 \\ \hline 
   \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

\item $E[G_A] = (3 \times 2/9) - (2 \times 4/9) - (2 \times 1/9) + (1 \times 2/9) = -2/9$
\item giving 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E[G_A] &=& 3p_Ap_B - 2p_A(1  p_B) - 2(1 - p_A)p_B + (1 - p_A)(1 - p_B)\\ &=& 1 - 3p_A -
3p_B + 8p_Ap_B\\
\end{eqnarray*}

) Finally, suppose that A and B independently and randomly display H and T with respective probabilities A p and 1− pA;  pB and 1− pB.  Calculate the four outcome probabilities and show that the expected gain to A may be written: 
 
   B ABA p ppp 8331 +−− . 
 
 Noting that this may be written as 1− pA(3−8pB)− 3pB or as 1− pB(3 −8pA)− 3pA, discuss whether you would prefer to play as A or B and how you would play. \\ \hline

\begin{itemize}
\item If $p_B = 3/8$ ;$E[GA] = 1 - 3p_B$ from the first alternative form; in this case \[E[G_A] =
1 - \frac{9}{8}  = - \frac{1}{8}\]
\item Hence choose to play as B, with $p_B = 3/8$ ,which in the long run will guarantee a win of $1/8$
(since $E[G_B] = -E[G_A]$)
\end{itemize}
