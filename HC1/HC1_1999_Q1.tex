1 Outcome probabilities are:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item  P(H=B) = 1/2 and so P(T=A) = P(T=B) = 1/2 .
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Hence every entry in the body of the table is the product of marginal probabilities (by
independence),1=2 £ 1=2 = 1=4.
\item Writing GA = Gain for A;GB = Gain for B ,
\item E[GA] = (3 £ 1=4) ¡ (2 £ 1=4) ¡ (2 £ 1=4) + (1 £ 1=4) = 0 = E[GB]
since this is a two person game.
    \end{itemize}

\item E[GA] = (3 £ 2=9) ¡ (2 £ 4=9) ¡ (2 £ 1=9) + (1 £ 2=9) = ¡2=9
\item giving E[GA] = 3pAPB ¡ 2pA(1  pB) ¡ 2(1 ¡ pA)pB + (1 ¡ pA)(1 ¡ pB) = 1 ¡ 3pA ¡
3pB + 8pApB
\begin{itemize}
\item If pB = 3=8 ;E[GA] = 1 - 3pB from the first alternative form; in this case \[E[GA] =
1 - \frac{9}{8}  = - \frac{1}{8}\]
\item Hence choose to play as B, with pB = 3=8 ,which in the long run will guarantee a win of 1/8
(since $E[GB] = -E[GA]$)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
