\begin{enumerate}
\item  For one leg, there are 4 possible colors in each of the three positions, making
4 £ 4 £ 4 = 64 combinations.
\begin{itemize}
\item For the other leg there will also be 64, and of the 64
on one leg may be combined with any of the 64 on the other to make 64 £ 64 = 4096
combinations in all.
\item ALTERNATIVE,there are 6 positions altogether, and four possible colors may appear
on each,making 46 = 4096
\end{itemize}
\item Consider the middle position on one leg: it can hold any one of 4 colors, there
are only 3 possibilities for each of upper and lower (they could be the same);so each leg
has 3 £ 4 £ 3 possible patterns ,i.e.36.Any of these patterns can also appear on the leg,
making 36 £ 36 = 1296 possible combinations in all.
\item In this case the possible number of combinations is 4£3£2on each leg, i.e.24£
24 = 576 altogether.
\item In(i),since there are 64 combinations for one leg. there are only 63 for the other:
64 £ 63 = 4032in all.
In(ii),similarly ,there are 36 £ 35 = 1260.
In(iii), similarly, there are 24 £ 23 = 552.
\end{enumerate}
