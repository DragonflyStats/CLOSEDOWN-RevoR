\item 
P(group test + ve) = 1 ¡ P(grouptest ¡ ve)
= 1 ¡ P(all k individuals ¡ ve)
= 1 ¡ (1 ¡ P)k
\item The N persons form m independent groups ,each group having a group test: also
if the group test is positive there are k individual tests, so this happens with probability
(1 ¡ (1 ¡ p)k)
Hence the number of test is sk = m + k £ x,where x is the number out of the m
groups where individual tests have to be made; so x is Binomial(m; 1 ¡ (1 ¡ p)k).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item The mean and variance of Binomial(n; ¼) are n¼, n¼(1 ¡ ¼). hence
E[x] = m(1 ¡ (1 ¡ p)k); V [x] = m(1 ¡ p)k(1 ¡ (1 ¡ p)k)
since N=mk
E[sk] = m + kE[x] = N
k + N(1 ¡ (1 ¡ p)k) = N[ 1
k + 1 ¡ (1 ¡ p)k]
V [sk] = k2V [x] = Nk(1 ¡ p)k[1 ¡ (1 ¡ p)k]

\item When P=0.01
E(s10) ¡ E(s11) = N( 1
10 ¡ 1
11 ¡ 0:9910 + 0:9911)
= N( 1
10 ¡ 1
11 ¡ 0:01 £ 0:9910) = 4:7089 £ 10¡5N
E(s12) ¡ E(s11) = N( 1
12 ¡ 1
11 ¡ 0:9912 + 0:9911)
= N( 1
12 ¡ 1
11 + 0:01 £ 0:9911) = 1:3776 £ 10¡3N
Both of these are positive, so E(s11) is less than E(s10)andE(s12).
ALTERNATIVELY by directly calculation as below.

\item When p=0.05,
\begin{itemize}
\item E[s4] = N[1:25 ¡ 0:954] = 0:435494N
\item E[s5] = N[1:2 ¡ 0:955] = 0:426219N
\item E[s6] = N[ 7
6 ¡ 0:956] = 0:431575N
\item E[s7] = N[ 8
7 ¡ 0:957] = 0:444520N
\end{itemize}

k=5 minimizes E[sk] in this range.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item When k=1
E[s] = N(2 ¡ (1 ¡ p)) = 1:01N for P = 0:01
= 1:05N for P = 0:05
\begin{itemize}
    \item this suggests that when P is very small the total number of tests skcan be very substantially
reduced. 
\ite mEven for P=0.05 it is (more than) halved. 
\item Also the group size may
be larger the smaller P is: the above results suggest optima of k=11 or 5 for p=0.01 or
0.05. 
\item As P increase there is less scope for economy of testing.
\end{itemize}
