This has 11 – 2 = 9 df and so σˆ 2 = 302.5147.

(since t = 0 ) = 27.5013.
Hence SE(αˆ ) = 5.24 and SE(βˆ ) = 1.658.
\item  The { ε
i} in the linear model are usually assumed to be independent, from the
same Normal distribution, mean 0, variance σ 2. As y increases with t, it is possible
that the variance also increases (heteroscedasticity); and due to likely trade-cycles
and also non-linearity of the model, independence may also be doubtful.
\item  The correlation coefficient r = 0.9067 = 0.952 . This shows a strong linear
relation between y and time. Alternatively, r2 shows that 90.7% of the variation in the
annual GDP figures can be explained as a linear trend in time, with positive slope
(βˆ =15.52 ). The slope is the average annual increase in GDP over the period, which
is £15.52 bn (expressed at 1995 prices); this is over 2% of the annual figure.
αˆ = 704.65 was the figure estimated for t = 0 , i.e. 1994, on the basis of all the data
(the actual figure allowing for the random variation was 694.6).

\item  t = −3 ; yˆ = 704.6545 − (3×15.5118) = 658.12 .
t = +3 ; yˆ = 704.6545 + (3×15.5118) = 751.19 .

\item  Note that because of the "flat" period in the first 4 years (or the drop back in
1991, however this is interpreted), the linear relation is forced to have a somewhat
smaller slope than seems necessary to explain 1991 – 1999 well.
For 2000, yˆ = 704.6545 + (6×15.5118) = 797.73. Because of the slope not reflecting
the years' GDP in late 1990s, this estimate is probably low (but not unreasonable).
For 2010, yˆ = 704.6545 + (16×15.5118) = 952.84, but this can only be a guess as the
relationship may become curved, or the slope change, or a discontinuity happen (as in
1990/1), and extrapolation so far ahead is not really of any use.
