\begin{enumerate}

\item  P(all 13 from 39 non-spades) =
\begin{eqnarray*}
\[\frac{  {39 \choose 13} }{  {52 \choose 13}}  
&=& \frac{39! \times 13! \times 39!}{13! \times 26! \times 52!}\\
&=& \frac{39 \times 38 \times \ldots 28 \times 27}{52 \times 51 \times 41 \times 40}\\ 
&=& 0.1279\\
\end{eqnarray*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
\item  There are 32 "low" cards (2 up to 9) and 20 "high" (10 to Ace). Hence all 13
are selected from 32, so probability is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\[\frac{  {32 \choose 13} }{  {52 \choose 13}}  
&=& \frac{32! \times 13! \times 39!}{13! \times 19! \times 52!}\\
&=& \frac{32! \times 39! }{ 19! \times 52!}\\
&=& 0.000547 \\
\end{eqnarray*}

\item  6 of the 13 Hearts, and 7 of the remaining 39, must be selected.
Probability is ( ) ( )

\item The division of Clubs must be 3, 3, 3, 4 between players, any one of whom
can be the person who receives 4; there are 4 ways for this. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the first player
receives 3, this can happen in
$ {13 \choose 3}$
 

ways, then

, the divisor being the number of ways of
splitting 52 cards into 4 hands of 13 each.
\item Probability is
\[ = 4 \frac{[13!39!] .[ 10!29!] .[ 7!19!] .[1] [13!13!13!13!]}
{[3!10!10!29!] [3!7!10!19!] [3!4!10!9!] [52!]}
\]
\[ = 4 \frac{(39)!(13!)^5}{(52!)(10!)^3(9!)(3!)^3(4!)}\]
\[  = \frac{(39)!(13!)^5}{(52!)(10!)^3(9!)(3!)^4}
\[ \approx 0.1054\]
