\item  There are 32 "low" cards (2 up to 9) and 20 "high" (10 to Ace). Hence all 13
are selected from 32, so probability is

\item The division of Clubs must be 3, 3, 3, 4 between players, any one of whom
can be the person who receives 4; there are 4 ways for this. If the first player
receives 3, this can happen in
