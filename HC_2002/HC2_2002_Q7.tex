Higher Certificate, Paper II, 2002.  Question 6 
 
 
(i) We might reasonably suppose that each trial (i.e. a rat trying a door) has the same probability p of success, independently of all other trials.  These trials continue until there is success, on the xth trial;  there is only one order in which this can occur, namely x − 1 failures followed by one success, so we have ( ) ( ) 11 xP X x p p −= = − . 
 
The possible values of x are 1, 2, 3, … . 
 
In this case, if the rat is "guessing" there will be probability 1/3 of choosing the food door on any trial;  i.e. p is 1/3.  The weakness in this argument may be that the rat does not "guess" because it can detect food, e.g. by smell.  If that occurs, P(food door) is >1/3, and unknown. 
 
 
(ii) Expected frequencies are

 for x = 1, 2, … on the null hypothesis 
of a geometric distribution with p =1/3.

Because the geometric distribution tails off very slowly, it is not easy to combine expected values, but the above grouping is better than combining the whole tail from (say) 5 upwards because the pattern is better preserved (and degrees of freedom are saved). 
 
No parameters were estimated, so there will be 5 degrees of freedom for the usual chisquared test using x = 1; 2; 3; 4; (5, 6); ≥ 7.

= 3.98. 
 
This value is not significant when compared with 2 5χ .  The geometric hypothesis is not rejected.  Therefore we may assume the model is satisfactory, and the animals do appear to be "guessing".
