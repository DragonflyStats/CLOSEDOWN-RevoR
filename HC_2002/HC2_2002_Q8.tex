8. An estate agency wishes to investigate the selling prices of three-bedroomed houses in a popular suburb of a large city.  To do this it randomly samples 20 sales of such houses from the previous month's records.  The selling prices (in £s) were as follows. 
 
  68 000   85 950   78 000   95 000   99 950   85 000 120 000 122 950   97 500   74 950 105 000   75 000   95 000 115 000 119 950   82 950   79 950   95 000   85 000 108 000 
 
 
(i) Draw a box and whisker plot of the selling prices and hence comment on the distribution. (10)

(ii) The agency is surprised that the selling prices varied so widely.  It takes a sample of 30 sales in an adjacent suburb and finds that the selling prices £x are summarised by 
 
  2 2 864 490 and 278 338 961408 xx Σ = Σ = . 
 
Test whether the house prices in the two suburbs were equally variable, stating any assumptions you make. (10)

(i) Prices (£000) in rank order are 
 
68, 74.95, 75, 78, 79.95, 82.95, 85, 85, 85.95, 95, 95, 95, 97.5, 99.95, 105, 108, 115, 119.95, 120, 122.95. 
 
The median is the 1 2 "10 'th" observation in ascending order.  The 10th and 11th are both 95, so the median is 95. 
 
The lower quartile is between the 5th and 6th, which are 79.95 and 82.95.  It is acceptable to take the average of these, though other detailed definitions are also in use.  The upper quartile is found in a similar way.  On this basis, we take lower quartile:   () 1 79.95 82.95 81.45 2 +=,      upper quartile:   () 1 105 108 106.5 2 += . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[Note.  This plot might not appear exactly correct, due to screen and/or printer resolution.] 
 
 
 
The median is approximately in the middle of the box, and the two whiskers are about the same length, so the distribution is not far from symmetrical.  There is also some clustering in the middle, near to the median, so a Normal distribution could be proposed as a model for these data.

(ii) For these data (using a pocket calculator;  some care is needed to preserve accuracy in dealing with the large numbers both here and for the adjacent suburb), 1 888 150y =∑ and 2 183 450 567 500 y =∑ , giving s = 16535.5222, so 2 273 423 493.4211 ys = .  (n = 20;  19 degrees of freedom.) 
 
 
For the adjacent suburb, n = 30, 2864490 x=∑ and 2 278 338 961 408 x =∑ , so () 2 22 1 1x x sx nn   =− −   ∑∑ is () 1 4 828 862 738 166 512 508.2069 29 = .  (29 degrees of freedom.) 
 
 
Test statistic for equality of variances is 22 /y xs s = 1.642 which is not significant when referred to F19,29.  There is not sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which is 22 "" XY σσ = . 
 
 
The F test is valid on the basis of apparent Normality for the original data, and the assumption that this is also true for the other sample.
