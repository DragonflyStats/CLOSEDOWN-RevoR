Higher Certificate, Paper I, 2002. Question 8

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{framed}
8. The ages in years, x, and scores, y, of nine trainees in an aptitude test are tabulated
below. Plot these data on a graph, comment on their suitability for correlation and
regression analysis, and calculate the product-moment correlation coefficient, rxy
say.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
Trainee & A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H & I\\
Age, x & 16 & 16 & 17 & 19 & 19 & 19 & 20 & 20 & 25 \\
Score, y & 46 & 53 & 50 & 48 & 53 & 55 & 50 & 53 & 69  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note: Σx2 = 3309, Σy2 = 25633 and Σxy = 9183.

Fit a simple linear regression of score on age to these data, and use the fitted line
to estimate the average score for a trainee aged
(a) 18,
(b) 26.

There appears to be an outlier (25, 69), without which correlation (and the regression
gradient) would be near 0. (Rank correlation may be more appropriate.)

You are now told that trainee I is the only trainee to have experienced higher
education. Recalculate the correlation and regression without this person, and
comment on your results.

[Hence the null hypothesis "b = 0" is rejected.]
However, without I, Σx =146 , x =18.25; Σy = 408 , y = 51.00 .

positive gradient, but not significantly different from 0.
