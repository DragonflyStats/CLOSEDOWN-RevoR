(i) The sum of all the entries in the table is 80k. Hence 1
80
k = .
(ii) Row and column totals give the marginal distributions of X and Y:
X 0 1 2
P(X) 1/4 1/2 1/4
Y 0 1 2 3
P(Y) 1/8 3/8 3/8 1/8
(iii) For P( X = x |Y = 2) , use ( )
( )
and 2

3/8

3/8
= 0.3
(iv) E[X] = 1, E[Y] = 1.5, by symmetry. The distribution of XY is:
XY 0 1 2 3 4 6
P(XY) 29/80 18/80 18/80 2/80 9/80 4/80
[ ] 120 1.5
80
E XY = = .
So E[XY ] = E[X ]E[Y ]. Therefore Cov( X,Y ) = 0 , so correlation = 0.
(iv) Zero correlation is not sufficient. Every individual P( X = x, Y = y) in the
table must be the product of its two marginal probabilities.
Consider x = y = 0 . We have (0,0) 1
80
P = k = . But (0) (0) 1 1 1

there is not independence.
