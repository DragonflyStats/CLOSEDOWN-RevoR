Making use of some or all of the above data, write a report of appropriate length on some aspect or aspects of United Kingdom trade, 1992-1999.  Your report should incorporate such diagrams and such statistics calculated from the table as you think appropriate. (20)

Major points to be included are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}

 
 
\item  Percentages of GDP for Exports and Imports show a similar pattern, first increasing then reducing again.  The following figures can be plotted as a time-series graph: 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccccccc} 
  & 1992& 1993& 1994& 1995& 1996& 1997& 1998& 1999\\  \hline
  E/GDP & 23.56 & 25.35&  26.38&  28.35&  29.14 & 28.47 & 26.47 & 25.77 \\        
  \% I/GDP & 24.77 & 26.40&  27.06&  28.74 & 29.69&  28.41 & 27.41&  27.48 \\ \hline
  Deficit I – E & 1.21 & 1.05 & 0.68 & 0.39&  0.55&  -0.06 & 0.94 & 1.71 \\
 \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
  
 
If plotted together, the pattern in (I – E) can also be seen, a decrease followed by an increase which was quite sharp in 1998 and 1999. 
 
\item Pie charts for some years, perhaps just 1992 and 1999, could be used to show the percentages of Exports and Imports which went to different regions.  Percentages for 1992, 1995, 1996, 1999 (in case a year in the middle is used also) are 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc} 
EXPORTS &  1992 & 1995 & 1996 & 1999 \\ \hline
EU &  54.2 & 52.9 & 52.1 & 52.8 \\
NA & 16.4 & 15.7 & 16.0&  19.4 \\
Other&  29.4&  31.3&  31.9&  27.8\\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc} 
IMPORTS  &  1992 & 1995 & 1996 & 1999 \\ \hline 
EU & 55.5 & 54.7 & 53.5 & 53.1 \\ 
NA & 14.4 & 15.2 & 15.7 & 16.3 \\ 
Other & 30.1&  30.1& 30.7 & 30.6\\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
 
\item  Indices of 1999 relative to 1992 could be calculated (1992 = 100): 
 \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
 Exports: &  Imports:  \\ \hline 
EU 156.1 &     EU 155.7 \\   
NA 188.8 &      NA 183.4 \\  
Other 151.9 &     Other 165.1 \\
   Total 160.3 &     Total 162.5 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
 
 
 
Note that current prices are used, whereas scaling to constant prices is more helpful in understanding changes. 
\end{enumerate}
