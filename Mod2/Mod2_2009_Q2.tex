    \item Higher Certificate, Module 2, 2009. Question 2
X ~ N(52, 1) and Y ~ N(26, 0.5625).
So the distribution of the total contents of a bottle, X + Y, is N(78, 1.5625).
(i) ()(7578752.41.25PXY−⎛⎞+<=Φ=Φ−⎜⎟⎝⎠ = 0.0082
(where, as usual, Φ represents the standard Normal cdf).
(ii) We want ()2.22.20XPPXY⎛⎞>=−>⎜⎟⎝⎠ .
Now, X − 2.2Y ~ N(52 − (2.2×26), 1 + (2.22×0.5625)), i.e. N(−5.2, 3.7225).
()(0(5.2)2.20112.69523.7225PXY−−⎛⎞ ∴−>=−Φ=−Φ⎜⎟⎝⎠ = 0.00352 (approx).
Similarly, (1.81.80XPPXYY⎛⎞<=−<⎜⎟⎝⎠ and we have
X − 1.8Y ~ N(52 − (1.8×26), 1 + (1.82×0.5625)), i.e. N(5.2, 2.8225).
()(05.21.803.09522.8225PXY−⎛⎞ ∴−<=Φ=Φ−⎜⎟⎝⎠ = 0.00098 (approximately).
P(ratio differs from 2 to 1 by more than 10%) = P(X/Y < −1.8 or X/Y > 2.2)
= sum of the above two probabilities = 0.0045 approximately.
(iii) Using the final answer of part (ii), the exact distribution of the number of bottles in 1000 with ratios different from 2 to 1 by more than 10% is the binomial distribution B(1000, 0.0045).
A suitable approximation is Poisson(4.5).
From the cumulative Poisson tables, the probability of 10 or more such bottles is 1 – 0.9829 = 0.017 to 3 decimal places.
