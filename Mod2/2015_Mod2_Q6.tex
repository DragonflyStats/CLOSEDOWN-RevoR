6. A sample of n independent measurements is drawn from a symmetric distribution, so
that the mean and median of the distribution, m, are equal. Describe how a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test can be used to test the null hypothesis m = m0
against the alternative
hypothesis m  m0
at the 5% level, where m0
is a given value. Include in your answer
a discussion of the use of tables and of a large-sample formula.

The ages, in years, of six randomly selected purchasers of a particular product are 20,
41, 24, 61, 32 and 48. The distribution of ages can be assumed to be symmetric.
(i) Use a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to test the null hypothesis m = 26 against the
alternative hypothesis m  26 at the 10% level.
(6)
(ii) Explain how a 90% confidence interval for m can be obtained from this test
and investigate whether the following values are in this interval:
(a) 23.9;
(b) 50.9.
