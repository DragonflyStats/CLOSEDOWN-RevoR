f x x x ( ) (1 ) for 0 1,  
    
where  (> 0) is an unknown parameter. The proportions
1 2 , , , X X Xn
for a
random sample of days have been observed. It is required to test the null hypothesis
H0:  = 0.5 against the alternative hypothesis H1:  = 1.
(i) Find the form of the most powerful test, expressed in terms of
Y
n
, where
log 1  Y X    i

(ii) Use integration to show that, under the null hypothesis,
log(1 ) 2  E X   i
and

(iii) Using the central limit theorem and the results given in part (ii), show that,
under the null hypothesis, when n is large
Y
