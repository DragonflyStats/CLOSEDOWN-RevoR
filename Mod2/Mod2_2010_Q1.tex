[Alternatively, $P(X = 1 | X < 2)$ may be obtained as 1 − P(X = 0 | X < 2).]
    \item Each X is the number of successes in two Bernoulli trials with probability p of success. So, noting that the Xs are independent and p is the same for all of them, Y is the number of successes in 200 such trials and we have $Y \sim B(200, p)$.
    \item With p = 2/3, Y ~ N400400,39⎛⎜⎝⎠, approximately.

\[= 1 − 0.859 = 0.141.\]
    \item With p = 0.02, Y ~ Poisson(4), approximately.
\[P(Y > 2) = 1 – P(Y \leq 2)\]

    \item Now $p = 0.98$.
Consider 200 − Y ~ B(200, 0.02) ~ Poisson(4) approximately.
P(Y ≤ 197) = P(200 − Y ≥ 3)
≈ 1 – P(Poisson(4) ≤ 2) = 0.762 approximately (as in (c)).
