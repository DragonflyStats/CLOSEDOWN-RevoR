\begin{enumerate}
    \item Question 3 (a) Let L be the volume of the large bottle in litres.
Let S be the volume of the small bottle in litres.
L  N(1:5; 0:012)
S  N(0:5; 0:0082)
(i) Take a random sample of 1 large bottle and 3 small bottles.
P(L > 3S) = P(L ï¿½ï¿½ 3S > 0) [1]
Let Y = L ï¿½ï¿½ 3S.
E(L ï¿½ï¿½ 3S) = E(L) ï¿½ï¿½ 3E(S) = 1:5 ï¿½ï¿½ 3  0:5 = 0
[1]
Var(Lï¿½ï¿½3S) = Var(L)+9Var(S) = 0:012+90:0082 = 0:000676

sd(L ï¿½ï¿½ 3S) = 0:026
NB The variance is not needed here, but some may not realise
that. It is not necessary to calculate, or even mention, the vari-
ance.

(ii) Let T = 10L + 3S.
E(10L + 3S) = 10E(L) + 3E(S) [1]
= 10  1:5 + 3  0:5
= 16:5 [1]
Var(10L + 3S) = 102 Var(L) + 32 Var(S) [1]
= 100  0:012 + 9  0:0082
= 0:01 + 0:000576
= 0:010576 [1]
T is a linear combination of normal r.v.'s so T is also normal [1]
T  N(16:5; 0:010576) [1]
(b) n = 50,  = 30g and  = 5g.
(i) As n is large the distribution of the sample mean tends to nor-
mality by the Central Limit Theorem. [1]
