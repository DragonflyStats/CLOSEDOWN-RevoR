a) Describe how computer Monte Carlo simulation can be used to
(i) compare estimators,
(4)
(ii) draw inferences in Bayesian analysis.
(4)
(b) Each item on a production line is given a quick test which has two possible
results: s1
(appears satisfactory) and s2
(appears unsatisfactory). However, the
test is itself prone to error so that if the item is satisfactory, P(s1
) = 0.9 and
P(s
2
) = 0.1, while if the item is unsatisfactory, P(s
1
) = 0.4 and P(s
2
) = 0.6.
After each item is inspected, it is either sold or scrapped. If a satisfactory item
is sold, there is a net loss of â€“2 units (i.e. a profit of 2 units), while if an
unsatisfactory item is sold there is a penalty resulting in a net loss of 10 units.
Any item that is scrapped results in a net loss of 1 unit.
(i) List the four decision rules for deciding whether each item should be
scrapped.
(2)
(ii) Calculate the risk table.
(8)
(iii) State, with reasons, which is the minimax rule.
