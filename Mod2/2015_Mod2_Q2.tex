2. A single observation X is taken from the distribution with probability density function
 
3
( ) 2 1 for x x f x e e x  
         ,
where  is an unknown parameter.
(i) Show that the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of X is
 
2
( ) 1 1 for x F x e x 
         .
(2)
(ii) Find the c.d.f. of Y = X –  and say why Y is a pivotal quantity.
(4)
(iii) Find a 90% confidence interval for  in terms of X based on the central 90%
  region of the distribution of Y (i.e. using the interval between the 5th and 95th
                                   percentiles of Y).
(8)
(iv) It is required to test the null hypothesis  = 1 against the alternative hypothesis
 > 1 at the 5% level using a critical region of the form X > k for some value
of k. What value must be chosen for k and what is the power of this test at
 = 5?
