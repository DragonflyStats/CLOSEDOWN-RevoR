Higher Certificate, Paper III, 2006. Question 4

(a) Remaining MA values are: at 13, ()1131413141513.8;5++++= at 14, (1141314151614.4;5++++= at 15, 15.0; at 16, 15.8; at 17, 16.2; and at 18, 16.4.

Intercept = ˆ16.3((0.1774)10.5)18.163ybx−=−−×=.
Thus the regression equation is sheep = 18.163 – 0.177 year.
   \item The graph shows that the 5-point moving average (AVER1) best reflects the sharp changes in sheep population in years 10 to 15 while the regression (FITS1) line reflects the overall downward trend.
An unweighted MA is appropriate in the absence of periodic or cyclic effects.
   \item The residual (error) terms have zero mean, constant variance and are uncorrelated. An assumption of Normality (so that the uncorrelatedness would imply independence) would also be needed it formal tests were to be carried out rather than only estimating the parameters. There does appear to be some sort of serial pattern in the data, rather than purely random variation from year to year. This makes the assumption of uncorrelatedness doubtful.
