Higher Certificate, Paper I, 2006. Question 7
(i) The sum of all 12 table entries is 30c. These probabilities must add up to 1, so c = 1/30.
(ii) The marginal distributions are given by the row and column totals.
Hence: P(X = 1) = 15c = 1/2; P(X = 2) = 10c = 1/3; P(X = 3) = 5c = 1/6.
Similarly: P(Y = 1) = 12c = 2/5; P(Y = 2) = 6c = 1/5; P(Y = 3) = 6c = 1/5; P(Y = 4) = 6c = 1/5.

(iv) X and Y are not independent [even though Cov(X, Y) = 0 and even though some cells have P(X = x, Y = y) = P(X = x).P(Y = y)]. For example, we have P(X = 1, Y = 4) = 2/15, but P(X = 1).P(Y = 4) = 1/10.

(v) U = 1 if X = 1 or 3 U = 0 if X = 2
V = 1 if Y = 1 or 3 V = 0 if Y = 2 or 4

2c = 1/15

Values of U

10c = 1/3
10c = 1/3
20c = 2/3
12c = 2/5
18c = 3/5
Consider the cell with (U, V) = (0, 0). The cell probability is 1/15 but the product of the marginal probabilities is 2/15. So U and V are not independent.
