\begin{enumerate} 
\item  The graph suggests that a linear fit will be reasonable, at least as a first approximation.  There may be curvature in the relation of weight and length.

 (b) The first three points are not fitted at all well.  Note that the intercept is –509.56, whereas it looks as if it should be much nearer 0 if these are to be fitted.  But the remaining points are fitted reasonably well.  It would however be sensible to examine also a quadratic relationship. 
 
 
\item  The coefficient of determination is given by R2 = Sxy2/SxxSyy.

Thus 94.6\% of the total variation in the weights of the sea bass is explained by a linear relationship with their lengths.
