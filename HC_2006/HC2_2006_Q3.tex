\begin{document}Higher Certificate, Paper II, 2006.  Question 3 
 \begin{framed}
A sample of 10 sea bass was caught by a fisheries scientist who then measured their length x (in millimetres) and their weight y (in grams).  The data are given in the table below. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} 
Length (x) &387 & 366& 329& 293& 273& 268& 294& 198 &185 & 169 \\ 
Weight (y) & 720& 680& 480& 330& 270& 220& 380& 108  & 89 &  68 \\
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}
(i) Plot the weights of the 10 sea bass (on the y or vertical axis) against the corresponding lengths (on the x or horizontal axis).  Does it appear appropriate to fit a straight line to these data? (8) 
 
(ii) (a) Calculate the least-squares estimates of the parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ 1 of the regression line y x 0 1 ββ += .

(b) Comment on the appropriateness of the regression line estimated in part (a) as a model for the relationship between the weights and lengths of sea bass. (8) 
 

 \end{framed}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item  The graph suggests that a linear fit will be reasonable, at least as a first approximation.  There may be curvature in the relation of weight and length.

 (b) The first three points are not fitted at all well. 
 
 \begin{itemize}
     \item Note that the intercept is –509.56, whereas it looks as if it should be much nearer 0 if these are to be fitted.  
     \item But the remaining points are fitted reasonably well. 
     \item It would however be sensible to examine also a quadratic relationship. 
 \end{itemize}

(iii) Calculate and interpret the coefficient of determination. 
\end{framed} 
\item  The coefficient of determination is given by 
\[R2 = \frac{Sxy2}{SxxSyy.}\]

Thus 94.6\% of the total variation in the weights of the sea bass is explained by a linear relationship with their lengths. 
\end{enumerate}
