Higher Certificate, Paper I, 2006. Question 8
(i) Yi = a + bxi + ei, i = 1, 2, …, n.
The {ei} are uncorrelated random variables with mean 0 and constant variance σ 2.
The method of least squares is equivalent to the method of maximum likelihood for estimating the regression coefficients (a and b) if the {ei} are Normally distributed.
[If the analysis is to proceed to inference for the regression coefficients, Normality of the {ei} is required.]
(ii)(a) For Yii , we minimise S = 2ieΣ = ()2iiyxβ−Σ.
We have (2iiidS xyxdββ=−−Σ which on setting equal to zero gives 2iiixy β, so the least squares estimate is 2ˆiiixyxβ=ΣΣ.
[Consideration of 22dSdβ confirms that this is a minimum: 22220idSxdβ=>Σ.]
(b) See scatter plot at foot of page. It shows an increasing trend, roughly linear; but there seems to be some increase in variability as x increases. There are not enough data points to be sure.
The usual summary statistics (not all required for the zero intercept model) are
n = 10, Σxi = 180, Σyi = 40, Σxi2 = 5150, Σyi2 = 244, Σxiyi = 1055.
ˆβ∴ =
1055/5150 =
0.205. So the fitted line is y
=
0.205x.
Hence the estimated expected number of violations for x = 20 is 0.205 × 20 = 4.1.
Logically, zero traffic flow should imply zero speed violations, so that y should be 0 when x is 0, i.e. the zero intercept model seems reasonable. The scatter plot does not contradict this.
