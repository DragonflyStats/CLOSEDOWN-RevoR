Higher Certificate, Paper I, 2006. Question 8

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Yi = a + bxi + ei, i = 1, 2, …, n.
The {ei} are uncorrelated random variables with mean 0 and constant variance σ 2.
The method of least squares is equivalent to the method of maximum likelihood for estimating the regression coefficients (a and b) if the {ei} are Normally distributed.
[If the analysis is to proceed to inference for the regression coefficients, Normality of the {ei} is required.]

(b) Over a period of one month, a survey was made on each of ten main roads in a large city. 
Each road was observed for a one-hour period randomly chosen during the working day. 
For each road, the mean traffic flow, xi (in vehicles per minute), and the number of speed limit violations, yi, i = 1, 2, …, 10, were recorded. 
Plot the data shown below on a suitable graph and comment on the suitability of the above model. 
Fit the model to the data and hence estimate the expected number of violations on a road 
with an average traffic flow of 20 vehicles per minute. Without any further calculation, comment 
on the suggestion that an intercept should be included in the model.

\item (a) For Yii , we minimise S = 2ieΣ = ()2iiyxβ−Σ.
We have (2iiidS xyxdββ=−−Σ which on setting equal to zero gives 2iiixy β, so the least squares estimate is 2ˆiiixyxβ=ΣΣ.
[Consideration of 22dSdβ confirms that this is a minimum: 22220idSxdβ=>Σ.]
(b) See scatter plot at foot of page. It shows an increasing trend, roughly linear; but there seems to be some increase in variability as x increases. There are not enough data points to be sure.
The usual summary statistics (not all required for the zero intercept model) are
n = 10, Σxi = 180, Σyi = 40, Σxi2 = 5150, Σyi2 = 244, Σxiyi = 1055.
ˆβ∴ =
1055/5150 =
0.205. 

\begin{itemize}
\item So the fitted line is y
= 0.205x.
\item Hence the estimated expected number of violations for x = 20 is 0.205 × 20 = 4.1.
\item Logically, zero traffic flow should imply zero speed violations, so that y should be 0 when x is 0, i.e. the zero intercept model seems reasonable.
\end{itemize} The scatter plot does not contradict this.
