\begin{document}Higher Certificate, Paper II, 2006.  Question 1 
\begin{framed}

1. The duration of a "normal" pregnancy (i.e. one without medical complications) can be modelled by a Normal distribution with mean 266 days and standard deviation 16 days.  In an urban hospital in a relatively deprived area of the USA, a random sample of 60 pregnancies was studied and the duration of each pregnancy determined.  The relevant statistics were 
 
2 15568, 4054484 xx == ∑∑. 
 
(i) Test whether the variance of this sampled population differs from that of "normal" pregnancy durations. (10) 
 

\end{framed}

 \begin{enumerate}
\item The variance of this sample is 
 
2 2 1 15568 15106.93 4054484 256.05 59 60 59
s
⎛⎞ = − = = ⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ . 
 
The null hypothesis to be tested is "σ 2 = 256".  It seems obvious that this null hypothesis is not likely to be rejected (even if the sample had been of considerably smaller size), but continuing with a formal test we use test statistic 
 
2
2 ( 1) 59 256.05 59.01 256 ns σ −× ==
 
 
which is referred to .  The upper 5\% point is about 78.  Clearly we cannot reject the null hypothesis as the data give no evidence for doing so. 2 59χ
 
 
\begin{framed}
(ii) Test whether there is evidence that the mean pregnancy duration for this sampled population differs from 266 days.  Find an approximate p-value for your test, and state your conclusions clearly. (10) 
\end{framed} 
\item We have  15568 259.46 60 x ==  and we wish the test the null hypothesis μ = 266.  Taking the value of σ as 16, which seems highly plausible from part (i), we use test statistic 
 266 3.1616 60 x − =− 
 
and refer to N(0, 1). 
 [Alternatively, we could continue to use the sample variance s2 (= 256.05) and refer 266 60 x s − to t59;  this makes hardly any difference in practice in this case.] 
 
This is well beyond the double-tailed 1\% point of N(0, 1);  there is strong evidence against this null hypothesis.  It is reasonable to conclude that this population has a mean different from the "normal" one;  it appears to be less. 
 
Using N(0, 1), we have , giving a p-value of 0.0016.
