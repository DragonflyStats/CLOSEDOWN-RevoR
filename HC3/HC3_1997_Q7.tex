7. A factory manager wishes to know whether or not the number of rejects produced by an industrial process within a set period follows a Poisson distribution.  The previous month’s data, given below, are thought to be typical:
Number of rejects 0 1 2 3 4 5 6  or more Frequency 38 49 43 17 11 2 0
(i) For what reasons might the rejects follow a Poisson distribution?
(ii) Test the hypothesis that the distribution of rejects is Poisson, and explain your result to the factory manager.


\end{framed}


The value of the test-statistic is 
\[ {\displaystyle \chi ^{2}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {(O_{i}-E_{i})^{2}}{E_{i}}} \]

\begin{enumerate}
\item If the process is producing individual rejects “at random”, i.e. singly and
at unpredictable instants of time, but at a constant rate over the period
of study, then the number of rejects during a fixed time of observation will
follow a Poisson distribution.
\item The mean must be estimated from the data:
¯x =

(0 + 49 + 86 + 51 + 44 + 10) =

Obs: 38 49 43 17 11 2 160

(The last two cells may be combined, but this is not really necessary.)
Â2 has 4 d.f., since 1 parameter had to be estimated and the totals of Obs
and Exp have to be the same.

\begin{itemize}
\item There is no reason to reject the hypothesis that the data follow a Poisson
distribution. 
\item Therefore the number of rejects per unit time is likely to remain
reasonably constant and they do not arise in any regular or predictable way.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
