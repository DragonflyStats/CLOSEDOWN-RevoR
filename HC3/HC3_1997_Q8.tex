\begin{itemize}
\item  A dot - plot for each set of data, on the same scale, is useful.
\item 923 for C seems highly unlikely. This level may be physically impossible, to
judge from all the other observations. Or it may be a recording error for 293
(or even 329).
\item  Residual S.S. = 19 £ 19797 = 376143; hence treatment S.S. = 70262 and
M.S. = 35131. The variance ratio is then 35131
19797 = 1:77.
The analysis, by itself, suggests that there are no significant treatment differences,
and also that the standard deviation of an observation is very large
(
p
19797 = 140:7).
\item Revised sums and S.S. are:

F is just significant at 5%. The estimated variance of an observation is 2191,
S.D. = 46.8. Means are: A, 316.6; B, 256.4; C, 274.3. Var[¯xA ¡ ¯xB] =

22:7 = 2:65¤, so A and B appear
to differ. Var[¯xA ¡ ¯xC] = s2( 1

28:7 , not
significant. A and C do not differ; nor will B and C.
\item The one doubtful observation greatly increased the variance estimate.
