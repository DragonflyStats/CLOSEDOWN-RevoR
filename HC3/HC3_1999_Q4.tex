4. The quarterly deliveries of phosphate fertilizers to UK agriculture are shown on the worksheet for this question.  A plot of the data is shown below. 
 
Complete the calculation of the centred four point moving averages and the estimated seasonal effects on the worksheet provided.  Use the estimated seasonal effects and the moving average trend values to complete the calculation of the residuals.  Plot the residuals against the quarter number (i.e. 1, 2, 3 or 4). (14)

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The completed worksheet is attached (see next page). Plot of residuals against quarters:
The 4M quarter residual in 1993 is very large. The quarterâ€™s delivery was much higher than
usual, and was higher than the previous quarter instead of the usual annual pattern for it to
be lower. (There was no compensating reduction the following quarter;hence the prediction is
also very far from observed. )
