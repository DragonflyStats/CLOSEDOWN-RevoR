\section{Introduction}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The completed worksheet is attached (see next page). Plot of residuals against quarters:
The 4M quarter residual in 1993 is very large. The quarterâ€™s delivery was much higher than
usual, and was higher than the previous quarter instead of the usual annual pattern for it to
be lower. (There was no compensating reduction the following quarter;hence the prediction is
also very far from observed. )
