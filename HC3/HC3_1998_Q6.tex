6. The values of the daily change in the FTSE-100 share index were calculated for the period from 31 December 1994 to 29 December 1996. Summary statistics for these daily changes are given below
n mean median Standard Deviation 520 0.52 0.35 23.43
The table below gives a grouped frequency distribution for the daily changes and some expected frequencies which have been calculated by assuming that the daily changes have a normal distribution.
(i) Complete the calculation of the expected frequencies and then test whether the assumption of normality is a reasonable one.

(ii) In many investigations the number of observations is much smaller, for example in many designed experiments the number of observations may be less than 30. Why would it be uninformative to use the method of part (i) to assess the normality of the residuals in such a designed experiment?

\end{table}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given that ¹ = 0:52 and ¾ = 23:43, the cumulative frequencies in a normal distribution are
given by 520 ©(Z);
for -67.5, ©(¡67:5¡0:52
23:43 ) = ©(¡2:903) = 0:00185; CF = 0:962;
for -52.5, ©(¡52:5¡0:52
23:43 ) = ©(¡2:263) = 0:01182; CF = 6:146.
Because of the very small expected frequency in the first group we shall combine it with the
second, to give Obs.=7, Exp.=6.146. Continuing down the table, the cumulative frequency to -7.5
is 6.146+21.063+57.512+105.632=190.353.
For +7.5, ©(7:5¡0:52
23:43 ) = ©(0:298) = 0:61715; CF = 320:918.
\begin{itemize}
\item Now 320.918-190.353=130.565, which is the frequency in (-7.5,+7.5).
\item For +37.5, ©(37:5¡0:52
23:43 ) = ©(1:578) = 0:94272. Hence the frequency in (22.5,37.5)=490.214-
320.918-108.573=60.723 .
\item Now check that 490.214+(22.873+5.789+1.106)=519.982=: n within acceptable rounding error.
\item For testing normality the last two groups are combined: O=3, E=6.895.
\item There are 9 groups, two parameters were estimated, so Â2 has 6 d f.
\end{enumerate}
Â2
(6) = (7¡6:146)2
6:146 + (26¡21:063)2
21:063 + (54¡57:512)2
57:512 + (90¡105:632)2
105:632 + (147¡130:565)2
130:565 + (102¡108:573)2
108:573
+(66¡60:723)2
60:723 + (25¡22:873)2
22:873 + (3¡6:895)2
6:895 = 9:20 n:s:
This provides no evidence against the fit to a normal distribution.
Unless there are enough observations to combine into several groups, the Â2 is a very poor
approximation, and also the pattern in the data is difficult to detect. Power against an alternative
of non-normality is very low.

(iii) Describe a graphical method which can be used to assess the normality of a set of residuals in a designed experiment. Illustrate your answer by showing how the method could be used for a randomised block design, with five treatments compared in six blocks?\\ \hline

\item There will be 30 residuals, which should be i.i.d. N(0; ¾2). If it is only normality that is
tested, and not only of the other assumptions made in analysis of a randomized block, a normal
probability plot is suitable. 

\begin{itemize}
\item The residuals are ranked in order, from largest negative to largest positive.
\item Normal probability paper allows these to be plotted against the order-statistics for a normal
distribution with a sample of 30 items; the ith observed value is plotted against ©¡1(i=31).
\item This
should give roughly a straight line. 
\item Further information comes from identifying which blocks and
treatments give the largest residuals, positive or negative. 
\item If, for example, one treatment seems to
have mostly large residuals it may be indicating that variances differ from one treatment to another.
