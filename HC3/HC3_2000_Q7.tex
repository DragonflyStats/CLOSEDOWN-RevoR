\item 
Because of the very irregular distribution and total table lake of concentration
about the mean, the assumption of normality can not be made and so a t test is not
valid. The summary measure of location, if one were needed, should be the median
(9.71 for A and 4.68 for B ). 
\item The Maun Whitney U test, will examine whether the two
distribution of times differ; so will the Wilcoxon rank same test.
Jocut ranking:
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10)
3:19 4:26 4:47 4:53 4:67 4:69 5:30 5:53 5:60 6:30
B B B B B B A A A A
(11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20)
6:79 6:92 9:37 12:51 12:75 12:78 12:95 16:04 18:21 18:24
B A B A B B A A A A
Sums of ranks are: A,134 ;B,76 (check : 134 + 76 = 210 = 1
2 £ 20 £ 21)
22
\[UA = 134 ¡
1
2
£ 10 £ 11 = 79 and UB = 76 ¡
1
2
£ 10 £ 11 = 21 Umin = 21\]
From table this is significant at 5%.
ALTERNATIVELY, count the number of times member of A come before B’s in the
ranking :U=4+4+4+4+3+2=21.(B’s before A’s gives U=79). A normal approximation,
strictly only for NA; NBboth>10, is that \[U is N( 1
2 £ 10 £ 10; 1
12 £ 10 £ 10 £ 21)\],so
\[2p1¡50
175 = ¡ 29
13:23 is N(0,1)\]; this is 2.19 and so gives the same significance
we may conclude that there is evidence of difference between the time distributions.
(The data suggest B tends to fail earlier)
