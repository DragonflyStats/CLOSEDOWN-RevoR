There is clear evidence of an interaction, i.e. species behave differently over time.
Main effects of species and time are not therefore relevant.

time (9) (12) (15) (18)

D 0:30 1:15 1:75 1:85
(iii)A increase up to week (15), then decrease; C has a similar pattern at a lower
level of area, B goes on increasing; so does D,slowly.
