So a Null Hypothesis that the poisson model holds is not rejected.
(iii) Assuming that the Poisson model is valid we use 2.525 as the variance, so
2:525 § 1:96
q
2:525
120 is an approximate 95% confidence interval for the true mean.
(a) This is 2:525 § 1:96 £ 0:145 = 2:525 § 0:284 or (2.24 to 2.81).
Note. it is often specified that this approximation require a mean of at least 5 to be
satisfactory.
(b)P(¸ 1) = 1 ¡ P(0) = 1 ¡ 0:080 = 0:92. This is an estimate of the proportion
of non-zero minutes, and variance is 0:92£0:08
120 which is 0.0006133, whose square root is
0.0248.
An approximate 95% interval for the true proportion is 0:92§1:96£0:0248 or 0:92§0:049,
i.e. 0.87 to 0.97.
