8.(i)The treatment combinations used in a factorial design are made up of all possible combinations
of levels, or amounts, of several factors that may affect the response being measured. For example,
15
an industrial process may depend on the time for which it runs, T, and the temperature at which it
is operated, U. If several values of T and of U are used, say T1; T2; T3; T4 and U1;U2;U3 a factorial
design requires all twelve combinations T1U1 to T4U3 to be used, usually in two or more complete
replicates.
The response to one factor may take a different pattern at different levels of the other: e.g. at
U1 there may be a linear change from T1 to T4 whereas it is quadratic at U2, and irregular at U3.
This is interaction between T and U and is not discovered unless a factorial design is used.
Totals of responses are required for analysis, i.e. means£ 5.

There is strong evidence of interaction between Animals and Plants. Graphs of the means for
the nine combinations are required.
In the presence of interaction, the main effects of the factors have little meaning. We may
note that levels for Red Deer are consistently above those for Camelids, which are also above those
for Goats.

Camelids show a different pattern from Goats and Red Deer, in that their intake from natural
grasses is relatively higher than from sown grass or heathers; the figure 1.973 is the odd one out
in the table of means.
