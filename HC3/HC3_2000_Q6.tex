(ii)The whiskers run from minimum value to lower quartile and form maximum value to
upper quartile; the median is marked inside the box. A symmetrical distribution would
have the median at approximately the middle of the box, and the two whiskers of about
the same length.

All of these patterns show skewness, positive in direction. For low concentration, the
average magnitude is considerably more than for higher concentration, but there is
skewness; the range of this set of data is less than for the other. The median brightness
appears to reduce as concentration rises. For median concentration the distribution is
nearer to symmetry except for the upper whisker.
For high concentration there is again high skewness(which may include outliers at the
upper end if we had the original data.).
(iii) An analysis of variance assumes (approximate) normality, and the same variance
in each set of data; neither of these seem to hold here. Because of the skewness, the
mean will not be a good central measure either.
(A transformation such as logarithmic may improve matters, but if there were outliers
these would still affect the analysis ).
