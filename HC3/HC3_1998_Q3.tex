3.(a)(i)In a sample survey, people are not compelled to respond and will only do so if the topic of
the enquiry interests them, if they think it is important, and if there is nothing in the approach
or the questionnaire that annoys them or puts them off. Questions of a private or sensitive native
will not be answered. In a postal questionnaire, or if they come early in an interview, this will
usually result in total non-response; at best be some missing data.
There is always some non-response in a postal questionnaire survey because people simply do
not complete and mail it back. Interviews of a selected random sample of people cannot always be
carried out 100% because some individuals refuse or are not available for interview.
(ii)Since non-response is often concentrated in certain parts of the target/study population, it is
important to minimize it to avoid serious bias.
Care over wording of questions, fore-testing of them, reminders is a mail survey, repeated visits
for interviews, keeping a questionnaire or interview as short as possible, even offering a reward or
prize to those who do reply, can sometimes help reduce non-response.
If people cannot be interviewed because they have moved, then can be replaced by ‘reserve’
randomly selected people. But unless there is a good reason replacements should not be made as
they can lead to bias.
