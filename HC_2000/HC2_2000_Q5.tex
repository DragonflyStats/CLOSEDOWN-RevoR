%%-- 5. 

Four different marine paints were compared for their ability to protect ships in a sea-going environment.  Sixteen ships were used, each painted with one of the four paints.  Each of the ships was deployed for 6 months and on the ship's return a score was assigned according to the amount of chipping, peeling and average remaining paint thickness.  A higher score indicated a "better" state of repair.  The scores are given in the following table. 
 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|} \hline
Paint 1 & 80 & 73 & 72&  90 \\ \hline 
Paint 2 & 81 & 82 & 88&  84  \\ \hline
Paint 3 & 93 & 80 & 80&  97 \\ \hline

\item  
After completing the analysis in part (i) you discover that each column of the above table represents a different geographical area in which the ships were deployed.  Using this additional information re-analyse the data and comment upon whether your conclusions are affected by this additional information. %%-- (10)

the means of the sores using the 4 points $i=1,2,3,4$;

\item 
Assuming the scores can be modelled by a normal distribution, the linear model underlining
this analysis is $y = \mu_i + \varepsilon_{ij}$ with $\varepsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$
\item we do not reject the N.H. that all
¹iare the same.
\item If the columns repeat geographical differences, we should remove these in a 2-way analysis.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Making allowance for area differences reduce the residual variation to that which is
purely random natural variation, so make the paints comparison more precise. 
\item Now the
N.H.should be rejected. there is evidence of a different among the paints.
