2. A government agency has developed a formula for calculating the theoretical carrying capacity of an urban roundabout.  Owing to a controversy about the usefulness of the formula, the civil engineering department of a university was asked to investigate the situation.  This they did by selecting ten roundabouts to which the formula was applicable, calculating the theoretical carrying capacity by the formula and observing the actual capacity for each roundabout.  The results of this investigation are shown below. 
 
Carrying capacity (hundreds of vehicles per hour) Theoretical capacity by formula (x) Observed capacity (y) Theoretical capacity by formula (x) Observed capacity  (y) 32.0 33.0 40.0 45.0 33.0 38.4 43.0 43.2 34.0 37.4 45.0 49.0 35.1 42.0 46.9 50.0 36.9 39.4 48.0 47.4

The method of least squares was used to fit a straight line to these data and some of the output from the package is shown below. 
 
The regression equation is y =  ***** + ***** x

(ii) P
y = 424:8 sxy = 17005:66 ¡ (424:8 £ P 393:9)=10 = 272:788
x = 393:9 sxx = 15840:23 ¡ 393:92=10 = 324:509
Hence the slope
ˆb
=
272:788
324:509
= 0:8406
The fitted line is y¡¯y =ˆb(x¡¯x) or y¡42:48 = 0:8406(x¡39:39) i.e. y = 0:8406x+9:3681
or y = 9:37 + 0:84x
\item The proportion of total variation (sum of square), that is explained by the relation
of observation to formula is to 0.843.[(229:31=272:18) ¼ 0:8425] this is reasonably
good.
\item The calculation is based on the theoretical model y = ®+¯x+",where var(") =
¾2 is estimated by s2 = (2:315)2 = 5:36 It has 8 d.f. var(ˆb) = ¾2=sxx estimated as
5:36
324:509 = 0:016517, so SˆE = 0:1285

A 95% interval for ¯ is :

§ 2:306 £ 0:1285 = 0:8406 § 0:2963 i:e:(0:544 to 1:137)
[t(8;5%) = 2:306]. A 95% interval for ® is :

p
5:36 £ 4:8813 = 9:368 § 11:795
This give(-2.427 to +21.16)
Note that this is very imprecisely determined(and is a little use since there are no data
near to zero to confirm whether a linear relation still holds)
