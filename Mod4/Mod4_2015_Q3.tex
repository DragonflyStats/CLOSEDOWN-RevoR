\item Question 3 (i) Sample product moment correlation coecient
rxy =
p Sxy
SxxSyy
; [1]
(or equivalent expression) where Sxy =
P
i(xi ï¿½ï¿½ x)(yi ï¿½ï¿½ y), [1]
Sxx =
P
i(xi ï¿½ï¿½ x)2, Syy =
P
i(yi ï¿½ï¿½ y)2. [1]
\item  zi = axi + b, a > 0
rzy =
p Szy
SzzSyy
[1]
where
Szy =
X
i
(ax + b ï¿½ï¿½ (ax + b))(yi ï¿½ï¿½ y) [1]
= a
X

(xi ï¿½ï¿½ x)(yi ï¿½ï¿½ y)

Syy stays the same.
Hence
rzy =
p Szy
SzzSyy
=
q aSxy
a2SxxSyy
= rxy for a > 0 [1]
and for a < 0, rzy = ï¿½ï¿½rxy. [1]

H0 : XY = 0 vs H1 : XY > 0
1% point 0.5923 [1]
At 1% signicance level there is strong evidence against H0, which
shows that there is a strong positive correlation between number of
chirps and temperature. [1]
