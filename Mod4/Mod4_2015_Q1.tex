Question 1 (i)
"i  N(0; 2) independent
Normal [0.5]
Independent or uncorrelated [0.5]
Mean 0 and variance 2 [0.5+0.5]
(ii) To nd the least squares estimators we must minimise S, where
S =
Xn
i=1
(yi ï¿½ï¿½ 0 ï¿½ï¿½ 1xi)2:
To do this we nd the solutions to the equations
@S
@0
= 0 and
@S
@1
= 0:
[1]
Now
@S
@0
= ï¿½ï¿½2
Xn
i=1
(yi ï¿½ï¿½ 0 ï¿½ï¿½ 1xi); [1]
@S
@1
= ï¿½ï¿½2
Xn
i=1
xi(yi ï¿½ï¿½ 0 ï¿½ï¿½ 1xi): [1]
So the least squares estimates b0 and b1 are solutions to the normal
equations
nb0 + b1
Xn
i=1
xi =
Xn
i=1
yi; (A) [1]
b0
Xn
i=1
xi + b1
Xn
i=1
x2i
=
Xn
i=1
xiyi (B): [1]
If we multiply (B) by n and (A) by
P
xi and subtract we obtain the
estimate for 1 as
b1 =
n
P

P

To nd the estimate for 0 we divide (A) by n and rearrange to obtain
b0 = y ï¿½ï¿½ b1x: [1]
(iii)
b1 =
201:665
3630:95

b0 = y ï¿½ï¿½ b1x =

Fitted model
y^i = b
0 + b
1xi = 1:168 + 0:056xi
(iv) Total SS = Syy = 12:9455.
Reg SS = b2

= 201:6652
3630:95 = 11:201
Residual SS = Total SS ï¿½ï¿½ RegSS = 12:9455 ï¿½ï¿½ 11:201 = 1:7449
This information can all be summarised in an Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA):
Source SS d.f. MS F
Regression 11.201 1 11.201 115.55
Residual 1.7449 18 s2 = 0:0969
Total 12.9455 19
where SS stands for sums of squares and MS for mean square.
SS column [2]
(Give full 2 marks if correct and [1] for 1 error.)
df column [1]
MS column [1]
F value [1]
Test H0 : 1 = 0 vs H1 : 1 6= 0.
F = 115:55  F1
18 if H0 is true; [0.5]
F1
18(0:001) = 15:38 [0.5]
give half a mark for the hypothesis and half for the use of the F
distribution.
Hence P < 0:001, OR strong evidence against H0, OR need X in the
model. [1]
Marks given for correct conclusion.
