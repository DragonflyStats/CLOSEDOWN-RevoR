Higher Certificate, Paper I, 2003. Question 6
E(Y) = np Var(Y) = np(1 – p)
(i) Binomial with n = 48, p = ¼.
(ii) Score is distributed 36 + B(12, ¼).
(a) Hence mean correct is 36 + (12/4) = 39 and variance is 12 × ¼ × ¾ = 9/4.
(b) Number wrong is distributed B(12, ¾).
(c) The required probability is 1 – P(0) – P(1) – P(2) based on the B(12, ¼)
distribution. This is

= 1− 0.031676 − 0.126705 − 0.232293 = 0.6093 .
(iii) Number of correct answers for A is distributed as 27 + B(21, ¼).
Number of correct answers for B is distributed as 28 + B(20, ¼).
Number of correct answers for C is distributed as 30 + B(18, ¼).
Means are 27 + (21/4) = 32¼, 28 + (20/4) = 33, 30 + (18/4) = 34½
respectively.
Variances are (21)(¼)(¾) = 63/16, (20)(¼)(¾) = 60/16 = 15/4, (18)(¼)(¾) =
54/16 = 27/8 respectively.
So overall mean is 1 (32.25 33 34.5)

[Note. C must get at least the 30 he knows, so it must follow that
P(C 29) = 0 , which is true if P(29 C) = 0 .]
