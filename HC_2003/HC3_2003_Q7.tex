Higher Certificate, Paper III, 2003. Question 7
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  (a) Non-respondents tend not to be a random part of the whole population,
but instead particular types of person are more likely to fail, or refuse,
to reply. Their responses, if known, would quite likely be different
from other parts of the population. Unless they are represented, the
results of the survey will not validly apply to the whole population.
Besides introducing this bias, intended sample size is reduced by nonresponse
and so precision suffers.
(b) Some possible procedures are as follows.
• Send the questionnaire again, once or twice more
• Send reminder letters (without the questionnaire)
• Telephone people who have not responded
• Visit those who have not responded, perhaps only a sample of them
These all require identification of non-responders, usually by means of
a number on the questionnaire which is kept separate from the answers
to preserve anonymity.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item (a) Strategy A will lead to a sample consisting of those who are easiest to
locate, so even if the list is constructed in a properly random way the
actual members used will not have been selected at random from the
list. Any who refuse at first request will be ignored rather than any
attempt being made to persuade them. Since there is a team of
interviewers, the more efficient of these may carry out a higher
proportion of the 600 (more quickly). Or, alternatively, quickly
completed interviews may not have been done so thoroughly. Why
stop at 600 instead of attempting to get as many as possible of the
originally selected list?
Strategy B will also lead to willing and easily available heads of
household being selected, so that the first sample of (600 – m) could
suffer considerable bias. The second sample of m ought to be more
representative, but the quality of the final data will be affected by how
large m is (the larger the better to avoid bias). Office work is also
increased by this method.

(b) The number R of respondents will be Binomial(n, ¾). Since n is bound
to be a large number, we may use a Normal approximation:
N 3 , 3

Solve this for equality, using only the upper value for n:-
2.326 3n = 2400 − 3n , or 3n + 2.326 3n − 2400 = 0 .
Write 3n = x , so we have x2 + 2.326x − 2400 = 0 , and the roots are
