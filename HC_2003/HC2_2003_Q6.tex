Higher Certificate, Paper II, 2003. Question 6
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i) yij = m + ti + eij ,
where yij is the measurement made on the jth unit receiving the ith treatment,
m is the underlying population mean of all observations and {eij} are
independent, Normally distributed, residual (natural) variation terms with
mean 0 and common variance σ 2.
This model separates the total variation among the {yij} into a systematic
component due to "treatments" ti and a random component represented by eij.
The number of replicates of treatment i is ri [i.e. we have j = 1, 2, …, ri for
each i], and Σri = N, the total number of experimental units.
(For the usual form of analysis, {eij} are assumed to be Normal, although
randomisation theory validates the inferences usually made from a one-way
analysis.)
(ii) (a) ri = 5 for i = A, B, C, D. N = 20. ΣΣyij
2 = 13666.
Treatment (fertiliser) totals are A 112, B 161, C 119, D 124.
Grand total G = 516.
Corrected total SS = ΣΣyij
2 – (G2/N) = 13666 – {(516)2/20}
= 13666 – 13312.8 = 353.2.

Analysis of variance

Fertilisers 3 287.6 95.87 23.38
Residual 16 65.6 4.10
Total 19 353.2
The F ratio is referred to F3,16 and is very highly significant, leading us
to reject a null hypothesis that there are no differences between
fertiliser mean yields.
Continued on next page
Fertiliser means are A 22.4, B 32.2, C 23.8, D 24.8 (kg).
σ 2 ("residual variation" or "experimental error") is estimated as 4.10.
Significant differences can be claimed between any pair of means
differing by at least

t σ = t t where (16) t
is the two-tailed 5% point of t16, i.e. 2.120. Thus (16) 1.281t = 2.71.
Clearly B is different from all the others and there are no differences
between A, C, D. Assuming that all the four fertilisers were applied in
the same way, at the same time, it is reasonable to claim that B is best.
The farmer simply needs to be told that statistical analysis very
strongly suggests that the four fertilisers did not all give similar results,
and that after allowing for the natural variations among the crop we
can say that B is clearly better than A, C, D.
(b) Five randomised blocks, the columns in the diagram on the question
paper, should be used. This will remove an "east–west" trend. In each
column, one replicate of each treatment (fertiliser) should be set out in
random order (different randomisations being used for each block).
