Higher Certificate, Paper III, 2003. Question 1
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Analysis of variance
Source of variation df SS Mean Square F ratio
Dial type 2 1377 688.50 6.67
Residual (Error) 18 1858 103.22
Total 20 3234
The F ratio of 6.67 is referred to F2,18 and is very highly significant (p =
0.007). We reject the null hypothesis that the mean numbers of errors with the
three dial types are all the same. We deduce that at least one mean is different
from the other two.
We have assumed that all sets of data come from Normally distributed
populations with the same variance σ 2.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item We have x2 − x1 = 20.0 , and the standard error of this estimate is
2 2
1 2

8 6 103.22 + = 5.487. [Thus the difference between the means for dial
types 1 and 2 is very highly significant: test statistic is 20.0/5.487 = 3.645,
refer to t18.] The 5% critical value for t18 is 2.101, so 95% confidence limits
for the true population mean difference μ2 – μ1 are
20.0 ± (2.101 × 5.487) or 20.0 ± 11.53, i.e. (8.47, 31.53).
This means that, on the basis of these experimental data, we can say with 95%
confidence of being correct that the calculated interval does contain the true
value of μ2 – μ1.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Residuals could be calculated for the 21 observations, and their pattern studied
either as a Normal probability plot or by plotting residuals against fitted
values.
The variances within the three dial types could be checked for equality, but no
good, sensitive, test exists for small amounts of data such as we have here.
Outliers, if any, could be checked for possible recording error or change in
background conditions. Any outliers could be removed from the data before
re-doing an analysis.
Sometimes a transformation (such as log) will make data behave more like
data from Normal homoscedastic distributions.
