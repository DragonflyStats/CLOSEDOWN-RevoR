%Higher Certificate, Paper I, 2003. Question 3

Hand-crafted widgets are made in two types, A and B. All widgets require an initial
process which takes a time X which is distributed as N(10, 12), i.e. Normally with
mean 10 minutes and variance of 12 minutes squared. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Type A widgets take a further random
time YA to complete, distributed N(15, 16)
\item Type B widgets take a further time YB,
distributed N(12, 9)
\end{itemize}
, where X, YA and YB are mutually independent.
\begin{framed}
(i) State the distribution of the total time to make
(a) a type A widget,
(b) a type B widget.
\end{framed}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \[X + Y_A \sim N(10 + 15 , 12 + 16)\] i.e. \[X + Y_A \sim  N(25, 28).\]
(b)\[ X + Y_B \sim N(10 + 12 , 12 + 9)\] i.e. \[ X + Y_B \sim N(22, 21).\]

\begin{framed}
Two particular widgets take the same time in the initial process. If one is of
type A and the other of type B, find the probability that the type A widget is
completed first.
\end{framed}

\item If X is the same for both, we require $P(Y_A < Y_B)$, i.e. $P(Y_A – Y_B < 0)$.
\[Y_A – Y_B \sim N(15 – 12 , 16 + 9)\] i.e. \[Y_A – Y_B \sim N(3, 25).
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(Y_A -Y_B \leq 0)   &=& P(Z \leq -0.60) \\
&=& \Phi(-0.60) \\
&=& 0.2743
\end{eqnarray*}

 
where (as usual) $\Phi$ denotes the cdf of the N(0, 1)
distribution. From tables $\Phi(–0.6) = 1 – \Phi(0.6) = 0.2743$.

(iii) Find the probability that a randomly chosen type A widget has a shorter total
completion time than a randomly chosen type B widget.

\end{framed}
\item  Writing $W_A = X + Y_A$ and $W_B = X + Y_B$, we require $P(W_A < W_B)$, i.e.
$P(W_A - W_B < 0)$.
\[W_A - W_B \sim N(25 - 22 , 28 + 21)\] i.e. N(3, 49).

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(W_A -W_B \leq 0)   &=& P(Z \leq -0.4285) \\
&=& \Phi(-0.4285) \\
&=& 0.3341
\end{eqnarray*}

Widgets of each type are packed in boxes of 16. Find the probability that the
sample mean completion time for a box of type A widgets is less than that for a
box of type B widgets.
\end{framed}

\item  $\bar{W}_A$ is $N(25, \frac{28}{16})$ and is $\bar{W}_B$ = $N(22, \frac{21}{16})$. 

Let $U =\bar{W}_A -\bar{W}_B$ ; then U is N $(3,\frac{49}{16})$, and we require $P(U \leq 0)$

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(U \leq 0)   &=& P(Z \leq - 1.7143) \\
&=& \Phi(- 1.7143) \\
