Higher Certificate, Paper III, 2003. Question 3

\begin{framed}
3.
A random sample of n insurance policies of a particular type, all of which have been in
force for 10 years, has been taken. The numbers of claims made are x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n . A
Poisson distribution with parameter λ is to be used to model the number of claims.
(i)
(ii)
Derive the maximum likelihood estimator of λ .
(5)
An insurance company has taken a random sample of 75 policies of the same
type. All of these have been in force for ten years. The numbers of claims
made are summarised below.

(a) Use an appropriate statistical test to assess whether a Poisson
distribution is an appropriate model for this set of data.

(b) Obtain an approximate 95\% confidence interval for the mean of the
underlying distribution.

gives a maximum.

\item (a) If a Poisson distribution gives a good fit, its mean is estimated by the
sample mean x , since we have no more specific information about λ.

Probabilities expected with λ ≡ λˆ = x are 1.6 (1.6) / ! x e− x for x = 0, 1, 2, … .
Expected frequencies are 75 times these.
P(0) = e−1.6 = 0.2019 P(1) =1.6e−1.6 = 0.3230 P(2) = 0.2584
P(3) = 0.1378 P(≥ 4) = 0.0788 .
(Each quoted probability is accurate to 4 decimal places.)
Hence we have

Expected frequency 15.14 24.23 19.38 10.34 5.91
A chi-squared goodness of fit test has 3 degrees of freedom, since there are 5
categories of data and 1 parameter estimated.

+ + + + = 4.29, which
is not significant (the 5% point of 2
1 χ is 7.81). Hence a Poisson distribution is
an acceptable model for these data.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item This is a reasonably large sample of data, although the mean value of
1.6 is somewhat low for using a Normal-approximation confidence interval.
An approximate 95% confidence interval for λ is
λˆ ±1.96 λˆ / 75 , i.e. 1.6 ± 0.286 or (1.31, 1.89).
[If the Poisson distribution is NOT assumed, use Σfx2 = 338, giving

, so s = 1.4046. Thus the interval is
1.6 ± (1.96×1.4046 / 75) = 1.6 ± 0.318 , i.e. (1.28, 1.92).]
