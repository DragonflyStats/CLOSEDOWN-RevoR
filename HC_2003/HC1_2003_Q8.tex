Higher Certificate, Paper I, 2003. Question 8

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Given paired data ${\displaystyle \left\{(x_{1},y_{1}),\ldots ,(x_{n},y_{n})\right\}} $ consisting of n  pairs, $ {\displaystyle r_{xy}}$ is defined as: 



\[  {\displaystyle r_{xy}={\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})(y_{i}-{\bar {y}})}{{\sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})^{2}}}{\sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-{\bar {y}})^{2}}}}}}  \]



 
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ${\displaystyle n}$   is sample size
    \item $ {\displaystyle x_{i},y_{i}}  x_{i},y_{i}$ are the individual sample points indexed with i
    \item $ {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}={\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}$ (the sample mean); and analogously for $ {\displaystyle {\bar {y}}}  $
\end{itemize}


This explains the strength of linear relationship between the xi and yi, with
$r = \pm 1$ showing linearity and r = 0 showing no linear relationship. The
underlying X and Y are both random variables.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item r near to +1, small amount of scatter about an (increasing) linear
relationship
\item  r near to –1, y decreases as x increases, otherwise as in (a)
Continued on next page
\item  Independent data ($r \approx 0$)
\item Non-linear relationship, e.g. y = x2
\end{enumerate}
\item  (a) Simple linear regression of y = cholesterol on x = age. y is the
dependent variable, x the independent. Assume a linear relationship
underlying the data, $Yi = a + bxi + \epsilon$
i, where the $\{ \epsilon_i\}$
 are independent
identically distributed N(0, σ 2) random variables with σ 2 constant for
all i.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $r = \sqrt(0.323)$ = 0.568 for 'chol' and 'age'.
$r = \sqrt(0.940)$ = 0.970 for 'newchol' and 'newage'.
\begin{itemize}
\item The latter consists of the 8 data points omitting the observation at
x = 27 which seems very far from the roughly linear pattern of the rest.
\item Omitting it has made a linear relationship seem much more plausible.
\item Subject number 2 has very high cholesterol for his age.
\end{itemize}


\item Using the "constant" row in either set of output, the constant term is
not significantly different from 0. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item A model omitting a could perhaps
be used.
   \item This would imply cholesterol 0 at age 0, which might not be very
sensible – but we do not actually have data in that region, so we
cannot claim that a linear relationship still holds.
   \item There is a tendency towards a curved relationship even when the very
"unusual" observation at age 27 is omitted. 
   \item The fit of a line without
that observation is however much better than with it, and the
diagnostic plots, of residuals and Normal probability, seem acceptable.
\end{itemize}
