The discrete random variable X has the binomial distribution
  ( ) (1 ) , 0,1, ..., , m x mx PX x x m
x
     
where m is a positive integer and 0 <  < 1. Show that X has moment
generating function
() 1 m t MX t e     .
Use this moment generating function to find the expected value and variance
of X.

(ii) X1, X2, …, Xn are independent random variables, each with the binomial
distribution given in part (i) in the special case where m = 1. Use moment
generating functions to prove that S = X1 + X2 + … + Xn is also a binomial
random variable.

(iii) State the Central Limit Theorem. Use it, along with the results from parts (i)
and (ii), to prove that the binomial distribution with parameters n and  can be
approximated by a Normal distribution for large enough n. State clearly the
parameters of this Normal distribution.
